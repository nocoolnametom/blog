!!! update "Update May 2013"
    This scripture has been removed by the Church Educational System from
    the Scripture Mastery list. However, it had remained within this list for
    over two decades and as such is still familiar to many graduates of the LDS
    Church's Seminary program. So I'm keeping this exploration of it online, but it
    is no longer applicable to CES.

We're In the Same Chapter As Before
-----------------------------------

The context of this chapter has already been covered in [the previous post][]. But in sum, Paul has been refreshing his Corinthian congregation on his ideas about Jesus's resurrection.  The entirety of chapter 15 is about the resurrection.
Previously, Paul indicated how Christ's resurrection leads to the resurrection of
all those who belong to Christ before the Kingdom of God arrives at the end of
the world.

After explaining this, Paul then moves onto *why* the resurrection of
Jesus was necessary.  In advance of the coming Kingdom, Jesus had been sent to
begin the rule of the Kingdom upon the earth.  Only when Jesus was the ruler of
all things could the Kingdom arrive.  The last obstacle of the present, evil world
to be overcome was death, and when Jesus became the master of death, then the
dead would rise and the kingdom would arrive.

At this point, Paul turns to asking his Corinthian friends a series of rhetorical questions.  If this was not the case, then why are they
baptized for the dead? What is the point of anything, if death remains in the world
and the dead do not rise?  We'll follow this line of questions with the next
post, where Paul attempts to respond to the question of what this resurrection will
be like (it seems that part of his attention here in chapter 15 was in response
to some doubt by some Corinthians about whether the resurrection would occur).

Baptisms In Place of the Dead?
------------------------------

This verse in question is thus one of the rhetorical questions Paul asks
in support of his position that a resurrection of the dead was about to
take place. This verse has puzzled Christians for centuries.  Martin Luther, for
instance, believed that Paul was referring to a practice of the Christians to
hold their baptisms over tombs as a reminder that Christ's sacrifice overcomes
death. Other interpreters felt that Paul was referring to a practice of
Christians being baptized before their death, and that Paul was saying that such a
baptism, so close to the end of life, would have little effect upon a person
unless their life would continue onwards long past that baptism after a resurrection
of their body.  Many note that Paul in Romans likens baptism to a symbolic
representation of the death and resurrection of the Christian and of Christ, and as
such he may be referring to baptism "for the dead" as a way of likening regular
Christian baptism to death (and thus reinforcing why it would be meaningless to
do so if there was no resurrection to follow, which for Paul is represented in
baptism when the initiate arises out of the water).  And still others feel that
Paul was making reference to a practice of baptisms in proxy for deceased
persons.

Joseph Smith revealed that God was allowing Mormons to practice proxy
baptisms in 1840.  In doing so, Smith referenced this verse as part of his
explanation for the practice.  Some Latter-day Saints will point to the presence of
the practice in both the LDS Church and 1 Corinthians 15:29 without making
mention of how Smith was aware of the scripture.  When this connection is not
mentioned, it can often appear that the biblical verse is acting as an independent
witness to the validity of the modern Mormon practice.  However, the LDS
practice almost certainly grew out of Joseph's pondering of the scripture in question,
and thus it is not independent from the 1840 revelation.

Distinctive, But Not Mormon
---------------------------

Also, it is important to note what is *not* said by Paul about the
practice. There is no mention of Temples.  There is no mention of who these dead
*are*, whether they are the recently deceased members of the community or
ancestors. There is no mention of the need for baptism for all humans (one of the
driving factors for Mormons to baptize their ancestors is to provide them with
an opportunity for baptism that was not available to them during their
lives). Paul doesn't even mention *who* is participating in this practice.  He
is talking to the Corinthians, but he very purposefully uses the
third-person plural "they" in discussing who is participating in the practice.  We
have no idea who he was referring to: the Corinthians or some other group?  Why
not say "why are *you* baptized for the dead" unless the Corinthians were
*not* doing it?  Some scholars through history have even speculated that Paul's
vagueness about who is involved in this practice might be evidence of his
personal disfavor of it, though this is certainly not a widespread idea among
most scholars.  The only thing that can be determined for sure is that Paul
is only using this verse *as an example* for why Christians believe the
resurrection will occur.

The word that matters in this verse is the word ὑπὲρ *hupér, *a
preposition that carries a range of meanings beginning with "over/above" and extending
to "standing in defense of, standing in place of, standing for, for" or
even "concerning".  It is the source for the English prefix "hyper", which
usually means "above".  So while Mormons are correct that the meaning can be
expressed as a proxy baptism (standing in place of), Luther's speculation also
makes grammatical sense (baptized *over* the dead).  The meaning, however, at
the time of Paul most likely would be best translated as "for" or "in place of".

Why Do I Think This Is Part of Scripture Mastery?
-------------------------------------------------

This scripture is given so that LDS youth have an example of a uniquely
LDS practice that can be shown to have its origin in the Bible.  Their interpretation of Paul referring to a practice of "baptism in behalf of
the dead" is a valid and correct interpretation, though within the context
of the chapter Paul is not making any statement about the validity or
necessity of the practice.  Instead, Paul is merely stating the existence of it as proof
that Christians believe in a resurrection of the dead.  Also, there are a
number of other viewpoint on this scripture that are also grammatically valid
that do not infer the existence of a historical practice of baptizing for the dead
the way that modern Mormons do for their ancestors.  But it *does* stand as an
example of something uniquely Mormon that can be found within the Bible
(because it seems that this scripture is the ultimate origin of the LDS practice,
so it shouldn't be too surprising).  In the [next post][] we'll see another attempt at finding unique Mormon doctrine within the
same chapter that fails completely once viewed within its context, but today
this verse is accurate, useful, and a good choice of a verse for a Mormon to
know about.
