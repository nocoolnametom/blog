Yet Again In the Same Chapter
-----------------------------

We've been looking at chapter 15 of 1 Corinthians for the past [two][] [posts][].
Today we hit the last of these three scripture mastery verses from 1 Corinthians.

It shouldn't surprise you after the past posts that we're still talking
about the resurrection.  In keeping with the context of the chapter, Paul
began by asserting that because Jesus rose from the dead, so too all would rise
before the Kingdom of God arrived.  Paul explained *why* this would happen and
why it was necessary.  Then he began a short series of rhetorical questions
to illustrate to his friends in Corinth that their beliefs and practices
displayed an assumption that such a resurrection would occur.

What is a Resurrected Body Like?
--------------------------------

In the context for these verses, Paul is responding to a question that
seems to have been posed against his belief in a physical resurrection.  "If
there *is* a resurrection of the body," someone seems to have challenged, "how does
that happen, and what would it look like?"

Paul responds by comparing the body to a seed.  The only way to get food
from a seed is to bury it in the earth.  To Paul, this is the same as
"killing" the seed, but without doing this the seed will not grow and live.  And the
grain doesn't come out of the ground as grain, but in a different and more
grand form than what it was before.  To illustrate how it can be that the grain
before and after sprouting are different, Paul explains how God has already made
many different kinds of bodies: bodies of men, bodies of animals, bodies of
fish, bodies of birds.  Then Paul moves on from animal life to the other
creations of God, which is where the scripture mastery verse begins.

In verses 40-41, Paul says that God has also created bodies in the
heavens, and bodies on the earth, and each of these bodies are different in glory
or reputation from each other.  And even the sun, moon, and stars
themselves differ in glory.

After Paul has finished describing the different types of creations and
bodies that God has made (ranging all the way from humans, to fish, to the
sun, moon, and stars), Paul returns back to what he was saying about the seed.  In
verses 42-44, Paul likens this process of a seed become a plant to the
resurrection of the body:

> <span>42</span> And thus the resurrection of the dead.  It is sown with ruin,
>  it is raised with perfection.
>  <span>43</span> It is sown with dishonor, it is raised with reputation; it is
>  sown with weakness, it is raised with power;
>  <span>44</span> it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body...

For Paul, the resurrected body is a "spiritual" body, which is as
different from the "natural" body as a plant is from a seed.  But he's already argued
that God knows how to make many different kinds of bodies; a spiritual body is
just another type of body that God can create.  For the rest of the chapter,
Paul relates how this resurrected body, this "spiritual" body, is far
different from the natural body.  The natural body was created in Eden of earthly
dust, but the spiritual body is from heaven.  The regular body of flesh and blood
will not enter the kingdom of heaven but it will changed to a purer body that
belongs in the kingdom.  Finally at the end of the chapter, Paul praises God who
has caused all of this to happen through raising Jesus.

What About The Three Heavens of Mormonism?
------------------------------------------

I'm sorry this post is so long, but it has to be because these
scriptures, when removed from their context within the chapter, are very important to
one of the most unique aspect of Mormon doctrine: the Three Degrees of Glory.
(Yes, the idea that there are three heavens was around before Mormonism, such as
in the writings of Emmanuel Swedenborg, with which Joseph Smith was familiar,
but it is, as far as I am aware, the only Christian tradition that has this
variated view of heaven into only three different areas).

Whereas Paul has been talking about the many different kinds of bodies
that God has created, listing humans among other creations such as fish and the
sun, Mormons generally view verses 40-41 out of their context to be talking
about the various type of *resurrected* bodies that God has in store for humans.
 When Joseph was editing the Bible, verse 40 received the following changes:

> ~~There are~~ also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial, ++and bodies telestial;++
>  but the glory of the celestial ~~is~~, one; and ~~the glory of~~ the terrestrial
>  ~~is~~, another; ++and the telestial, another.++

In Mormon thought, God has three different conditions or heavens
awaiting humans after the final judgement: the Celestial Kingdom for God's people who
merit it, the Terrestrial Kingdom for normal people, and the Telestial Kingdom
for the bad people (there is an "outer darkness" as well for the absolute lowest of
the low, but nobody knows for sure who goes there).  Mormons believe that each
kingdom actually requires a body prepared for these kingdoms, so that people
with celestial bodies are those who go to the celestial kingdom, and so on
with the other two types of kingdoms each with their associated body.

Is this a valid way of reading this verse?  No, it's not.

Joseph's Linguistic Problems
----------------------------

The English word celestial is based on the Latin "caelestis", meaning
"heavenly".  The Greek from verse 40 is ἐπουράνια *epouránia*, which
also means "heavenly".  If you take the *epo* off of the front (which is what
makes it a word "concerning" something) you get the root *uránia,* which should
be recognizable as the same root for the planet Uranus.  And the English
word terrestrial is based on the Latin "terrestris", meaning "earthly" or
"ground". The Greek from verse 40 is ἐπίγεια *epígeia,* also meaning "of ground,
of earth".* *Taking off the *epi* prefix, hopefully you can recognize the
word *geia* which usually in English gets turned into Gaea.

The word *telestial*, on the other hand, is a word that is unique to
the scriptures of Joseph Smith.  It has no known root, though some Mormons
have speculated that it might be based off of the Greek word *telos*,
meaning "end, finish, purpose" (it's a popular word for Plato/Socrates).  Why two of
the kingdoms would have English names based off of Latin roots, but the
other would have a name based off of a Greek root is never explained.  (Besides, to
me the word "telestial" simply looks like a poor attempt at a word spelled
halfway between "terrestrial" and "celestial".)

Also never explained is why Joseph made these changes to these verses.
 In context, Paul has been listing the various types of bodies that God has
created. He describes heavenly bodies as part of this list.  He then continues
to talk about how the new spiritual body is different from the old natural
body.  In the Greek he is not referring to different methods of resurrection.  He is
referring to how things in the heavens are so very different from things on the
earth. This difference of kind is reflected in the difference of resurrected
and mortal bodies.  Bodies "telestial" doesn't make any sense within the Greek
context of this verse.

Now of course Mormons believe that Joseph Smith was a prophet.  The
majority of their beliefs about the Three Degrees of Glory can be found in Section
76 of the Doctrine and Covenants.  Just because Joseph twisted 1 Corinthians
15:40 in such a way as to introduce "telestial" to the list of bodies in an attempt
to describe the levels of Mormon salvation doesn't mean that Mormons have
nowhere from which to obtain the teaching.  Recovering the correct context
and interpretation of these verses doesn't destroy the doctrine of the
Degrees of Glory, but it does return a correct understanding to the writings of
Paul for Latter-day Saints.

Why Do I Think This Is Part of Scripture Mastery?
-------------------------------------------------

This scripture was chosen so that LDS youth would have a biblical source
to claim when discussing a very unique Mormon belief: that there are three
heavens for humans to end up in.  Unfortunately, this viewpoint is arrived at
by removing these verses from their surrounding content as well as adding
another word, *telestial*, to the verse that cannot be traced to any ancient
language definitively that would also make sense in the Greek context.  A Mormon
trying to present these verses as support for their beliefs of the afterlife
would make no progress in convincing anyone who is familiar with the chapter that
it is describing three forms of resurrection and salvation.  It is not a
correct interpretation, it adds nothing to the argument that Paul is making (in
fact, if the Mormon reading is allowed to stand it makes Paul's argument
significantly more confusing at this point), and it should be dropped as one of
multiple sources for the doctrine.  Mormons can depend upon the other sources
they already have for this belief beyond a misapplication of Paul's
teachings on the resurrection in 1 Corinthians.
