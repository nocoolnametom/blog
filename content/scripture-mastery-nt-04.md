##### Update May 2013

*This scripture has been removed by the Church Educational System from
the  
Scripture Mastery list. However, it had remained within this list for
over two  
decades and as such is still familiar to many graduates of the LDS
Church's  
Seminary program. So I'm keeping this exploration of it online, but it
is no  
longer applicable to CES.*

* * * * *

Matthew 25 has Jesus giving his final address to his disciples before
entering  
Jerusalem.  The setting is everyone sitting on the Mount of Olives
overlooking  
the city.  Jesus discusses the coming kingdom of God through parable
and through  
prophecy.  In this chapter we have Matthew's versions of some famous
parables,  
such as the Ten Virgins and the Stewards.  The particular "parable"
that this  
scripture comes from is the Sheep and the Goats (cue the mental
playback of  
Cake's "Sheep go to heaven, Goats go to hell"), which is less of a
full  
narrative parable and more of a simple allegory.  Jesus says that when
he comes  
in his glory (remember we're dealing with an apocalyptic worldview in
Matthew's  
gospel; the Kingdom of God is about to break forth over the world with
glory)  
the "son of man" will assemble all nations before him and divide them
just like  
a shepherd might divide a mixed flock of sheep and goats.

Matthew, again completely in line with his focus on Torah observance and
the  
Jewish/Christian concerns for the poor and destitute of society, quotes
Jesus as  
saying that the basis for this division will be the things the people
have done  
to others: feeding the hungry and thirsty, housing the homeless,
clothing the  
naked, visiting the sick and the imprisoned.  Jesus says that the King
(a  
character certainly associated with the "son of man" in verse 31, but
not  
explicitly linked as the same character) treats the actions as though
they had  
been done to himself.  Conversely, in the next verses after the
scripture  
mastery verse, the King says that all of the negative actions have also
been  
done to him (not feeding the hungry and thirsty, not taking in the
homeless, not  
clothing the naked, not visiting the sick and imprisoned) and as a
result they  
are sent into "everlasting punishment".  For Matthew's Jesus, what
matters is  
what you do, and how well do you adhere to those aspects of the Torah
that  
encourage beneficent activities towards the marginalized of society. 
The call  
of many Jewish prophets in the Hebrew Bible was against those of wealth
who  
oppress the poor, the widows, and the elderly.  Also, the Torah
explicitly  
mentions that during harvest-time, allowances must be made for the poor
to glean  
from the fields.  Matthew, as a Jewish Christian, portrays a Jesus who
not only  
says that such things matter, but that such things
matter *eternally* and that  
they will have a direct effect on each individual's long-term status
after the  
arrival of the Kingdom of God.

All of which is in rather direct opposition to earlier Pauline thought,
implying  
again that one of the purposes of Matthew's particular viewpoint might
be to  
promote a more Judean and pro-Torah Christian theology against existing
groups  
of Jesus followers who had rejected the Torah as a necessary code of
conduct for  
believers in Jesus.

Unfortunately, we will not be able to get into a full discussion of
Pauline  
views on faith and works until near the end of the series when we hit
James  
2:17.  At that point, we'll have a *lot* to say about Paul (and all of
the  
Pauline theology that the scripture mastery list skips over) and the  
relationship of his writings to those of other Christians.

Finally, this verse, and the idea that actions done to others are done
to Jesus,  
almost certainly is the inspiration for the famous scripture in the
Book of  
Mormon given by King Benjamin in Mosiah 2:17 (also a scripture mastery
scripture  
which we'll come to soon enough).  Also, some Christian thinkers have
expressed  
the possibility that these good and bad actions are actions
done *within the  
Christian community towards other Christians.*  Many Christians
who *do* get  
concerned about what this verse means for salvation by faith have
adopted this  
viewpoint to reconcile things.  Also, while Matthew as a Jew would have
believed  
that all humanity was descended from Noah and was thus family, it is
much more  
likely that in recording Jesus as saying "the least of these *my
brothers*" he  
was talking about people who were already members of the coming Kingdom
of God.  
A similar viewpoint seems to be expressed earlier by his Jesus when
instructing  
the Twelve in Matthew 10:40-42,

> <span>40</span> Whoever receives you receives me, and whoever receives
> me  
>  receives the one who sent me.  
>  <span>41</span> Whoever receives a prophet in the name of a prophet
> will  
>  receive a prophet’s reward. Whoever receives a righteous person in
> the name  
>  of a righteous person will receive a righteous person’s reward.  
>  <span>42</span> And whoever gives only a cup of cold water to one of
> these  
>  little ones in the name of a disciple, I tell you the truth, he will
> never  
>  lose his reward.

In his reference to "one of these little ones" many scholars think the
reference  
intended by Matthew is to the disciples Jesus is sending out as
missionaries. So  
this scripture might be more about salvation being based on truly
belonging to  
the community of Jesus followers than a statement that salvation is
based on  
works.

Why Do I Think This Is Part of Scripture Mastery?
-------------------------------------------------

On the surface, this scripture is a wonderful call for people to act
with good  
actions towards others as an expression of their love for God.  But is
also  
supports the idea that actions matter: in the parable, those who did
bad actions  
are sent into "everlasting punishment".  No mention of believing on the
name of  
Jesus to be saved, no mention of grace.  I think the reasons for having
this  
scripture in the list is two reasons of equal importance: I think that
the  
Church Education System truly wants to inspire LDS youth to be giving
and kind  
when interacting with the rest of the world, but I also think that they
want LDS  
youth to be equipped to use this scripture to push back when confronted
by the  
idea of salvation by faith.  The problem is that they've probably been
given the  
false impression that salvation by faith is unbiblical and they've
probably also  
been presented with a false straw man argument of what other Christians
believe  
who adhere to Grace theology.  But we'll cover this much more when we
hit James  
2:17, where this conflict and poisoning of the well before the fact is
most  
potent.
