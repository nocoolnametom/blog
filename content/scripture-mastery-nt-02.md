!!! update "Update May 2013"
    This scripture has been removed by the Church Educational System from
    the Scripture Mastery list. However, it had remained within this list for
    over two decades and as such is still familiar to many graduates of the LDS
    Church's Seminary program. So I'm keeping this exploration of it online, but it
    is no longer applicable to CES.

Ah yes, God and Mammon.  Can't serve both.  It's a *very* Matthean
approach, as the author of Matthew is very much concerned with issues of serving God
and keeping the Torah and thus emphasizing the stories and teachings of
Jesus that further this goal.  Very much in line with the issues of 1st Century
Judaism, Matthew presents the message of Jesus and service to God in opposition
to the pursuit of wealth.  Judaism and early Christianity were very focused on
the needs of the poor and lower classes of society (indeed, for the first
few centuries of the Christian movement, most Jesus followers were
themselves poor and members of the lower classes of classical society).  Matthew's very
Jewish perspective is thus very much in line with this verse.

What is interesting about this scripture is how it usually gets applied
with Latter-day Saints.  Latter-day Saints are an apocalyptic Church.
 That's not a slur or a smear (indeed, Christianity itself grew out of apocalyptic
Judaism and many strands of Christianity today are still apocalyptic in their
viewpoint), but rather just a short-hand way of saying that their theological point
of view is one of apocalypticism: the idea that God's justice upon an unjust
world is quickly approaching and that soon all inequalities, the result of sin
and evil, will be forcefully righted by the arrival of God's justice upon the
world.  For most apocalyptic societies, being on the very cusp of the approach of
God's kingdom is associated with that kingdom beginning to "break through"
into the world with visions, healings, and miracles.  And since part of the
message of the coming kingdom of God is that the arrival will be heralded by great
violence upon the unjust world, the only way to escape that violence is to join
with the kingdom before it arrives.  This can produce a worldview of those who
belong to the kingdom, the insiders, and everyone else, the outsiders, with an accompanying binary worldview of the world divided into those things
that either are with God and his coming kingdom or with the world that stands ready
to be destroyed.

This binary worldview produces the uncomfortable problem, however, of
what are followers of God supposed to do *before* the Kingdom of God arrives?
 How are followers of God supposed to live in the midst of a world living on
borrowed time?  Scriptures like this scripture mastery scripture serve to help
believers have the moral courage to stand with the apocalyptic society in those
places where the needs of the society conflict with the fallen world.  Whether
or not we, as 21st Century people, should agree with this morality is a tough
question.

From this point of view it should be plainly obvious why the original
point of the scripture, that the pursuit of wealth and power is in opposition to
being a follower of Jesus, has been extended for Mormons to mean more than just
wealth. The following are three examples provided in the Seminary manual for
youth to illustrate how Mormon youth are expected to view this scripture:

> 1.  Michael (age 18) chose to have a job that requires him to work
>     every >      Sunday so he can save money for his mission.
> 2.  Donna (age 16) says she is doing missionary work by having a
>     steady >      boyfriend who is not a member of the Church.
> 3.  Brother Smith (age 35) pays tithing and extra fast offerings on
>     the money >      he makes selling products in which he is not entirely honest with
>     his >      customers.

Apart from the oddity of having to specify the ages of these fictional characters, the "mammon" in question is not always money.  For the
first two examples, the "mammon" in question are actions not in keeping with the expectations of the religious community: working a job on Sunday and
having meaningful associations with those outside of the community.  It's
obvious that "mammon" as defined for Mormon youth is far more than the "riches"
meant by the author of Matthew originally two thousand years ago.  Of course, part
of the reason for an apocalypticist like Matthew's Jesus to avoid riches is
because riches belong to the rulers of the world, and the current rulers of the
world are evil and will be overturned when the kingdom of God arrives.  This
is part of the reason why Jesus tells some people to sell all they have, give
it to the poor, and their treasures will be in heaven.  To find salvation,
followers of Jesus need to reject this sinful and evil world that rules without
justice.  So this viewpoint of "Mammon" being the world, while technically
incorrect, is not entirely without merit.  However, for the apocalyptic Jesus this
rejection of the world is *far* stronger than just not working on Sunday or dating a
non- Mormon (seriously, this is a *real issue* for Seminary manual
writers?!?), but in fact represents a complete rejection of the present world.  The
message of Jesus in Matthew is not usually "be in the world but not of the world"
but is usually "reject the world entirely in preparation for the approaching
kingdom of God": indeed, you should even "take no thought what you should eat or
drink." Give up this world entirely and let your life be run fully upon God's
mercy until he arrives and you are given a position of power and authority in
his kingdom.

I personally think that a verse like this is a great example of how
problematic the New Testament can be.  It is an ancient book, written from a very
different point of view than how we generally read it in the 21 Century.  Unless
you agree that the end of the world is fast approaching and that your behavior
must include a rejection of wealth, power, influence, and the injustice of
this evil world in order to receive a place in the coming Kingdom of God (you
know, instead of just being a good person), then this verse can obviously
provide some very damaging perspectives on life.  We usually view the New Testament,
and the Gospels in particular, as books full of ethical statements on how to
treat our fellow humans.  It is, but the *reasons* for such treatment are usually
very different from what we might expect.  If we assume that the teachings
of the New Testament are meant for the 21st Century, we'll have a lot of
difficulty resolving statements like God and Mammon, or how one must reject family
to merit salvation in the Kingdom of God, or how Jesus is said to come to set
father against son, mother against daughter.  To me, this scripture is a good
example of how I view the New Testament: like a pet python.  Pythons are
beautiful, exotic, fascinating, and a lot of fun.  Yet they can also be dangerous
if they are approached without any care for what they truly are.  You don't
play with and treat a python like a puppy.  The New Testament is an artifact of
history, and to ignore the context and apply it without serious thought can be
dangerous. Do I agree that one cannot serve God and mammon?  Personally, no, but
to me the more problematic aspect is what these apocalyptic black and white
scriptures can do to people who simply accept them uncritically and how they then
interact with others in the world around them.  The examples from the Seminary
manual illustrate to me just how this sort of scripture can get in the way of
just being a good, ethical person.

And I would be remiss if I didn't mention that the Church itself, as a
corporate entity and not as individual members, has a huge problem in following
this verse.  As an incredibly large organization that charges itself with
serving millions of active members worldwide and handling hundreds of millions
of dollars of donated tithing for its operations, the LDS Church has
adopted a corporate character similar to many large corporate companies.
 Producing manuals, videos, pamphlets, programs, and countless other goods and
services requires paid employees, budgets, contracts, and all of the countless
headaches that go along with it.  The Church is in the uncomfortable position of
often having to figure out how to serve God *through* the use of mammon, and
frankly it doesn't always do a very good job at walking that line.  Perhaps
the statement of Matthew's Jesus *is* applicable today to the modern Church
Office Building, but if so one wonders what the solution could be.

Why Do I Think This Is Part of Scripture Mastery?
-------------------------------------------------

To help enforce a binary view of life as a choice between obedience to
God (represented in all examples as obedience to and activity in the
Church) and the "world" (a word often used colloquially by Mormons to mean everything
either non-Mormon or anti-Mormon, sometimes without distinction).  By
expanding the meaning of "mammon" beyond riches, youth are encouraged to keep all
aspirations, employment, relationships, and choices within the bounds defined by the
Church; because of this verse, they could easily be taught that doing so is the
only way to honestly serve God.
