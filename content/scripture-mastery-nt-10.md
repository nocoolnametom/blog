The Death of Jesus in John's Gospel
-----------------------------------

This is a popular one throughout Christianity.  It's from John 17, which
is a long prayer given by Jesus to God at the Last Supper, sometimes called
the "Intercessory Prayer".  One reason it's popular is that this prayer
occupies the place of the Garden of Gethsemane in Matthew, Mark, and especially
Luke. Whereas in those gospels Jesus is portrayed as suffering in prayer, as
in Mark, or perhaps a little ambivalent  such as asking God to "remove the cup"
before his upcoming death in Luke, in John Jesus is fully in command of the
situation, and this prayer to God is a plea not to remove the cup but rather for
God to honor and uplift Jesus's disciples.  In John's gospel, Jesus does not
approach his death with apprehension; in fact, for John, the death of Jesus is
not portrayed as a possibly-unexpected event, but is the climax of the book
with John working in symbolism of a emperor's coronation into the narrative.
 For John, the death of Jesus is the crowning achievement of Jesus's work
and the event that heralds the full arrival of the kingdom of God upon the
world (John's gospel, while still containing some apocalyptic elements, seems to have
been written long enough after the death of Jesus for much of the
apocalyptic warnings of the coming kingdom of God to be replaced with
the *spiritual* arrival of the kingdom as the gospel of Jesus being accepted and spread
by his followers; this tends to happen when people who feel that they were
promised they'd live to see the coming kingdom of God begin to die and you need
an explanation). (See my [post about the differences of the Gospels][] if you want to know more about these four very different and
non-coordinating works.)

Jesus Sent By God
-----------------

One of the main reasons for the inclusion of this verse, I feel, is the honorable and correct use of it as a pro-Christ verse.  This is a verse
that is central to Christian and Mormon theology: God sent Jesus Christ, and
that eternal life is wrapped up in developing a relationship with God and
Christ.  So much is wrapped up in this concept for both Mormons and Christians, so
I approve of its inclusion for this reason.  But I'd argue that there's another
less honorable and pretty much incorrect reason for this verse to be
included in a list of the most important scriptures from the New Testament for LDS
youth, and it has to do with Jesus's statement that life eternal is to *know, *or *understand* God.  In other words, it's commonly assumed that having a
correct understanding of the nature of God is part of attaining eternal life,
which for Mormons means living the same kind of life as God the Father: life as a
god.

The Only True God
-----------------

One interesting aspect of this verse is the phrase *ton mónon alāthinón
theón*, the only true god.  *Monon* should be recognizable to English speakers
in the numerical prefix "mono": monorail, monocle, monogram, monotheism, etc.
 It means "one", "single", "only".  This is a verse that seems to have been used
during the debates of the Nicene Council of 325 CE, part of the Arian heresy
that divided much of the Christian movements during the early Fourth
Century.  To try and simply summarize what was actually a very complex debate, the
Arians felt that only God the Father was an eternal God, and that Jesus, while
still divine and unique, was a being created by the Father in the distant past
before the creation of the world.  In explanation of their viewpoint, the Arians
pointed out that the terms "Father" and "Son" were without meaning if applied
to multiple beings who had always existed alongside each other and who
were equal in all power and glory.  Countered by the proto-orthodox viewpoint
(which only later developed into the strong Trinitarianism, but was an idea around
long before Nicea and wasn't invented there, merely promoted as correct)
that this resulted in a worldview of three gods, which was polythesim and was
soundly denounced many times in the Bible (such as in the 10 commandments), the
Arians responded by using this verse to imply that while Jesus was *a* god, he
was not a *True* God.  Jesus himself in this verse acknowledges that the Father
is the *only* "true" God.  Thus, they argued, the commandments for only
worshiping God the Father alone were still upheld, because there was only one "true"
God in the universe.  Jesus was a different *kind* of god because he had been
created by the one "true" God.  Needless to say, the nuance in such a view didn't
last in Christian thought, but Arianism itself held out for hundreds of years
after the Nicene Council as one of the most popular strands of Christianity in
the world.

The Modalist Heresy
-------------------

Mormons have a viewpoint that is *similar* to the Arians, but it should
not be confused as being the *same* viewpoint (and for those familiar with
the *homoiousios*/*homoousios* debate of Nicea, go ahead and laugh).
 Mormons began in a period of American history where many traditional aspects of
Christianity were being examined, doubted, and experimented with.  One aspect of
traditional Christianity that many original converts had trouble with was
Trinitarianism. The basic idea of Trinitarianism is that God is composed of three
beings: the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.  Now, as to whether God is a title for all
three, an aspect of the three that arises through their mutual love and unity,
or whatever, is a subject of much debate and thought.  The basic idea is
simply that there is one God and three persons.  Unfortunately, it is rather
easy for many Christians to unwittingly slip into another heretical belief when
trying to understand how a singular God is composed of three persons: modalism.
Modalism is the belief that there is only one God who *appears* to be three
different people at different times and in different places.  To over-simplify,
it's the belief that God has a "Father" mask that he wears when he needs to be
the Father, a "Son" mask that he wears when he needs to be the Son, and a
"Holy Ghost" mask for when the Holy Ghost is working in the world, but it's
the same person behind all three masks.  Most Mormons are surprised to find that
this view is a heresy, because it tends to be the viewpoint we are taught
growing up in the Church of what "other Christians" believe.  Modalist thought can
be found throughout Christian history, but it is always regarded by Christian
theologians as heretical and is corrected when found.  That doesn't mean that it
doesn't continue pop up all *over* the place even in congregations nowadays,
and it was commonly said to be an issue for many early seekers in America's Second
Great Awakening.  Even Thomas Paine, the writer of the revolutionary
tract *Common Sense,* discussed the oddity of the Trinity in his *Age of Reason*.
 It's bound to happen when people continue to use analogies to try and explain the
mystery of the Trinity such as "It's like water: it can be solid, liquid, or
gas but it's all water," or "It's like an egg: you have the shell, the whites,
and the yolk, but it's only an *egg* when all three are united together."

Mormons and Their "Trinitarian" Straw Men
-----------------------------------------

I still have more research to do on this point, so from here on out it's
my own supposition (though I'm rather confident in this hypothesis), but I
think it can be shown that the great divide between Mormons as non-Trinitarians and
other Christians as Trinitarians has its roots in *Mormon* rhetoric and not
in *anti- Mormon* rhetoric.  In other words, I think Mormons started
self-identifying as non-Trinitarians decades before other Christians even cared about the
issue.  I would argue that issues that are related to that divide, such as
Mormons believing in an embodied God or in human deification and theosis, can
and occasionally do live side by side with traditional Trinitarian thought.
 I think that eventually as Christians in general turned against Mormonism
during the 19th Century it was originally because of polygamy and the strong
control exerted upon members by Church leadership.  Eventually, some Christians
heard that Mormons also identified themselves as anti-Trinitarianists and so
came to agree that this was an issue, and today the argument that Mormons
cannot be Christians because of the Council of Nicea has been ongoing for so long
that everyone on both sides of the divide has forgotten who first started
saying it and everyone simply believes it is true because it's been said for so
long by both sides.  However, I'm still doing my own research into what the
earliest Mormon narratives on Nicea and the Trinity were and when and if they
changed.

Anyways, all of this is a very long way of saying that I think this
scripture is present because it's one of the main anti-Modalist scriptures (the
Arians in particular loved to use anti-Modalism scriptures and arguments because
it helped force their opponents into the uncomfortable position of possibly
having to argue against Arian ideas using heretical terms and ideas from earlier
Modalist thinkers).  Jesus is talking *to* God and mentions himself as being
separate. Mormons (incorrectly) assume that this scripture is thus speaking
against Trinitarianism.  For Mormons, this rejection of Trinitarianism is,
oddly, one of the most important differences between Mormonism and Christianity.  In
the First Vision account, where God and Jesus visit Joseph Smith as a young boy
to start him on the road to becoming a prophet, Mormons *routinely* will point
out that Joseph saw *two* "personages" in the grove where was praying and
not *one.*  But remember, this is because they've been perpetuating the idea of a
modalist Trinity for so long that today it is simply an accepted point among
Mormons that Christians are Modalists.  However, this isn't true, and unfortunately
the elevation of this scripture to be included in a list of the most
important scriptures for LDS youth almost certainly involves this scripture being
used to combat this false view of what other Christians "believe".

Why Do I Think This Is Part of Scripture Mastery?
-------------------------------------------------

For two reasons, one good and one bad.  The first, good reason is
because it is a scripture that speaks to one of the central doctrines of Christian
and Mormon theology: God sent Jesus Christ.  However, the second bad reason
focuses on the idea that life eternal is to "know God": for most Mormons this
knowledge includes a true understanding of the nature of God as
"non-Trinitarian," placed against a straw-man conception of "orthodox Christianity" that is
actually heretical for traditional Christians.
