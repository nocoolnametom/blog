##### Update May 2013

*This scripture has been removed by the Church Educational System from
the  
Scripture Mastery list. However, it had remained within this list for
over two  
decades and as such is still familiar to many graduates of the LDS
Church's  
Seminary program. So I'm keeping this exploration of it online, but it
is no  
longer applicable to CES.*

The Anonymous Letter to the Hebrews
-----------------------------------

The Letter to the Hebrews is completely anonymous and always has been
since the  
earliest records of it.  Of the author, an early Christian named Origen
who  
lived in the 3rd Century CE said, "only God knows."  Tradition has
assigned it  
to Paul only because Paul wrote so many other letters in the New
Testament  
(though some of these are written in his name by later authors), but
its  
placement in the traditional order of book speaks to its uncertain
status:  
whereas all of the letters of Paul are placed in order of length, from
the  
longest (Romans) to the shortest (Philemon), Hebrews is placed
afterwards.  The  
modern LDS Church assumes Pauline authorship but only because this is
the  
authorship assumed by early LDS Church leaders such as Joseph Smith.
 The book  
has no given author, and in the earliest manuscripts doesn't even have
a title;  
it's called "To the Hebrews" because its focus and message is centered
in  
Israelite temple ritual.

Whereas in Paul, the death and resurrection of Jesus are important from
an  
apocalyptic perspective (Jesus's rising from the dead heralds the
imminent  
arrival of the Kingdom of God), the author of Hebrews is interested in
Jesus  
from the perspective of what his death means for the Israelite temple;
the  
resurrection is not really emphasized in the letter.  The main message
of the  
book is an examination of what the author believes to be shortcomings
of the  
Temple at Jerusalem and how Jesus's death makes up for these
shortcomings.

The Shadow of Heaven
--------------------

For the author, the rituals of sacrifice at the Jerusalem temple were
meant to  
cleanse the people from sin, but the Jewish people themselves,
including the  
priests, were already corrupted by sin by virtue of being human.  Thus
the cycle  
of sacrificial offerings needed to continuously occur because the
rituals were  
performed by humans for humans.  Their sacrifices were imperfect since
they were  
performed by imperfect people using imperfect animals for the people.
 The only  
way for this situation to end was for a perfect human to perform a
perfect  
sacrifice that would end sin for all.  The author then presents Jesus
as this  
divine human; divine in that he is perfect and is God, but human in
that he  
suffers and cries out with tears.  Of course, when the Jerusalem Temple
had  
sacrifices they were performed on an altar, but Jesus was executed on a
cross  
and wasn't literally sacrificed.  The author resolves this by resorting
to a  
complicated dual worldview.  For the author, the temple at Jerusalem is
merely a  
physical "shadow" of the perfect temple in heaven.  The physical temple
is run  
by High Priests descended from Aaron, Moses's brother.  The heavenly
temple is  
run by Jesus, who is a High Priest "after the order of Melchizedek"
(more on  
this in a bit).  The physical temple is continually having sacrifices
of bread,  
incense, and animals for sins (which the people would then take home to
eat  
afterwards), but the heavenly temple has only had one perfect sacrifice
for the  
sin of all the world (celebrated by the Christian eucharist which the
people  
eat).  This sacrifice occurred in the heavenly temple, but the shadow
in the  
physical world was Jesus's death on the cross.  So for the author, the
meaning  
of Jesus's death is that it takes everything that Jews viewed as
important about  
their Temple and said that Jesus's death accomplished those same
things, only  
better.

Hebrews is a complicated work, but if you keep this "shadow world" idea
in mind  
it's much clearer than just trying to get through it on your own.

After the Order of Mechizedek
-----------------------------

Okay, Hebrews contains this odd references to Melchizedek.  Remember
that the  
author is presenting the physical temple as inferior to the heavenly
temple in  
every way.  The Priests of the Jerusalem Temple were set up, according
to Jewish  
scripture, by Moses himself and that the High Priests were descended
from Aaron,  
his brother (and amazingly enough, there is some genetic evidence among
modern  
Jews that there actually might have been a distinct genetic line among
Temple  
priests that goes far back in time; not that I'm saying Aaron is a
real  
historical person, but the lineage claimed to be his might have
existed  
concurrent with the ancient Jerusalem Temple).  How do you then present
this  
ancient lineage as being *inferior?*  The author goes back to Genesis
and to a  
small story about Abraham, the oldest patriarch, whose grandson Jacob
has twelve  
sons who became the twelve tribes of Israel, with one of those lines
being the  
tribe of Levi who officiated in the Temple.  The story is that Abraham,
after he  
rescued his relative Lot who had been kidnapped by neighboring
tribesmen,  
stopped at the town of Salem on his way home and was blessed by the
King of  
Salem, Melchizedek, and Abraham gave him part of the spoils of the
victory.  The  
author of the Hebrews says that since Abraham was the ancestor of Levi
and  
Aaron, that it was as though Levi and Aaron were *also* blessed by
Melchizedek  
and gave him gifts and treated him as a superior (in sperm form, if
that makes  
the image any easier).  It also helps that Genesis says nothing else
about  
Melchizedek, no explanation for why the ancient hero Abraham would have
given  
him part of the spoils and shown deference to him.  Around the time of
the 1st  
Century, it appears that myths and legends had arisen about Melchizedek
that  
because Genesis doesn't give his lineage that he *had* no lineage, but
was a  
mythical individual of power who had not been born but had always
existed (and  
thus had not died and continued to exist on the earth).  Such an
individual,  
with such a miraculous history, was surely an entity that Abraham would
have  
shown deference to, and by extension, so too would Levi and eventually
Aaron and  
eventually the Temple priests.

The Context for the Scripture Mastery Verse
-------------------------------------------

So the author of Hebrews says that while the physical temple is presided
over by  
Aaronic priests, the heavenly temple is presided over by Jesus, who is
a priest  
following the order of Melchizedek.

The verse above, in context, is mentioning that the High Priest of the
temple  
cannot assume that position on their own initiative, which is an odd
choice of  
words, as many High Priests *had* assumed that office in the previous
few  
centuries; it had become a highly politicized office (this
politicization is  
what led the Dead Sea Scrolls community to remove themselves from
Jerusalem and  
live in isolation above the Dead Sea, waiting for God to purify the
world and  
the Temple).  For this reason, it's assumed that he's not talking about
any  
individual in question, but rather about Aaron himself, and about the
Aaronic  
lineage.  Aaron had not asked to be put in charge of God's temple, but
God had  
bidden him to do it.  The lineage was selected by God.  Similarly,
God's  
election of Jesus had not occurred because Jesus had sought it, but
rather God  
had chosen him.

Mormon Priesthoods
------------------

What does this matter?  It matters because Mormons feel that, just as
the  
Jerusalem Temple required priests of Levi to run it and descendants of
Aaron to  
be High Priests, so too do Mormons feel that authority must be held to  
administer the modern Church.  The LDS Church claims both the authority
of the  
Aaronic Priesthood (though they make little claims to Aaronic ancestry)
and the  
Melchizedek Priesthood mentioned by the author of Hebrews.  For
Mormons, this  
authority is not only *required* for the Church to function, it is the
authority  
by which *all* things function.  It was this authority that was lost
through sin  
and apostasy that made a restoration needful.

For Mormons, this verse is saying that nobody can themselves claim the
authority  
of the Priesthood.  They must be called of God first.  This means that
all of  
the Christian Churches who baptized their people cannot do so
authoritatively,  
as their leaders have all merely sought this authority on their own.

But this scripture is talking about *Jesus, *not about humans in
general.  And  
the purpose of Jesus's Melchizedek Priesthood authority, to the author
of  
Hebrews, is to officiate over the great and lasting sin sacrifice of
himself  
once and for all.  It is a perfect Priesthood for a perfect sacrifice.

Modern Christians in general do not view authority as an important issue
in  
regards to the few rituals that Christians have, such as the Eucharist
or  
baptism.  When this scripture *is* viewed in relation to regular human  
Christians, it is interpreted to mean that people should feel inspired
or called  
by God before they undertake to minister to their fellow Christians.

The Mormon view of this scripture is wrapped up tightly with their
historical  
development of two levels of Priesthood (a development that took a long
time to  
occur as the Melchizedek Priesthood didn't even exist when the LDS
Church was  
officially founded).  Their presence in the LDS Church, when combined
with this  
verse in Hebrews, is taken to mean that all men (as the LDS Priesthood
is  
currently limited to only men, and until 1978 also excluded all blacks)
are  
called of God when they receive an ordination to these two Priesthoods.
 Other  
Churches cannot make the same claims of authority as the LDS Church
because they  
must be "called of God" before they can do so.  Thus it is only the LDS
Church  
that has the authority of these Priesthoods in action.  Regular
Christians,  
however, could certainly care less about this issue.  And the author of
Hebrews  
isn't talking about two levels of Priesthood present among early
Christians, but  
is rather talking about an earthly Priesthood for the Jerusalem
Temple's  
constant sacrifices and a heavenly Priesthood for the heavenly Temple's
single  
great sacrifice.

Why Do I Think This Is Part of Scripture Mastery?
-------------------------------------------------

This scripture is a foundation for why Mormons believe that Priesthood
is  
required for their rituals, such as baptism.  Nobody can simply choose
to  
baptise, but they must be called of God to do so, which is what Mormons
consider  
ordination into the Priesthoods to be.  However, the scripture in
question is  
talking about how Jesus was called of God to perform his perfect
sacrifice,  
which was performed only once, and says nothing about authority for
rituals and  
ordinances in the Christian Church.  Modern Christians either assume
that  
membership in Christ's covenantal community bestows such authority as
needed  
(called the  "Priesthood of All Believers"), that authority for these
rituals  
was never lost, or that authority is not needed for the rituals.  Many  
Christians would be confused at an LDS reading of this scripture as a
way to  
exclude their baptisms and sacraments as not being authorized because
many  
Christians feel strongly that God inspires humans to various Christian  
ministries.  To them, being "call of God, as was Aaron," is a call that
can come  
to anyone and everyone.
