!!! update "Update May 2013"
    This scripture has been removed by the Church Educational System from
    the Scripture Mastery list. However, it had remained within this list for
    over two decades and as such is still familiar to many graduates of the LDS
    Church's Seminary program. So I'm keeping this exploration of it online, but it
    is no longer applicable to CES.

Without Natural Affection
-------------------------

One quick translation issue: occasionally, I've heard multiple CES
teachers (both Seminary and Institute) interpret the phrase "without natural
affection" to mean "homosexuality".  This is not a correct interpretation but is
based entirely upon the word choices of the English translation. The word
under the phrase is ἄστοργος *ástorgos,* where the initial alpha is a negation
like the English prefix "un" and negates the word στοργή *storgā, *meaning "deep
love or affection" and usually used for affection between parents and a child
or between good friends.  It's not sexual in nature, and the term "without
natural affection" might be better translated as "sociopathic".  This idea can
still be found in the [official LDS Church Institute manual][], unfortunately,
where they quote Elder Spencer W. Kimball:

> There are said to be millions of perverts who have relinquished their natural
>  affection and bypassed courtship and normal marriage relationships.[^1]

[^1]: [Spencer W. Kimball, "Voices of the Past, of the Present, of the Future", April 1971 General Conference][]

If you hear anyone using this phrase in reference to homosexuality, even
if they're an LDS Apostle, you have my permission to interrupt them boldly
and declare their usage of it to be highly mistaken.  And I don't give
permission for that sort of thing lightly! :-)

The Pastoral Epistles
---------------------

The Letter to Titus and the Letters to Timothy are commonly known as
the "Pastoral" Epistles, from the Latin word for "shepherd", used by the
early Church for the office of bishop.  In the early Christian movement,
after an ecclesiastical structure emerged through years of
chaotic ecstatic self- governance, the office of Bishop quickly became the highest office of a
local church.  Over the course of the 2nd Century, a complicated
organization structure began to emerge:  deacons (male and female), teachers,
bishops (almost always men), evangelists, widows, (widows were women who, after their
husbands had died, were set apart in service to the local Church), elders.

The story of the Pastoral Letters is that Paul, on the sunset of his
life, is writing to two leaders of Christian communities: Titus, and his old
friend and oftimes missionary assistant, Timothy.  Paul's perspective here is a
calm acceptance of his impending death, but he wants to give a final word to
these younger leaders he loves.  The letter are rich with emotion, mostly of
kindness and grandfatherly advice, though he does state some rather passive
aggressive statements against his enemies.

The only problem is that Paul almost certainly didn't write these
letters. Their perspectives are extremely different from the genuine letters of
Paul that we've already covered.  Genuine Paul seems to have given little care to
issues of church hierarchy and authority.  In the Pastorals, he gives clear instructions on who is (and, by negation, who is not) *allowed* to
serve in specific offices.  Genuine Paul seems to have had little to say about
women (apart from a few verses in 1 Corinthians that seem to have been
interpolated by a later scribe), never mentioning gender as a qualification for belief
or of spiritual gifts and going insofar as to be the only New Testament
writer to refer to women leaders by name (Phoebe, a deacon, and Junia, an
apostle).  In the Pastorals, Paul infamously teaches about the lower roles of women
in the local congregation.  Genuine Paul fully expects to see the Kingdom of
God in his lifetime.  In the Pastorals, Paul has very vague references to the
coming day of the Lord, but gives a strong impression of much longer time scales.
 And, as with 2 Thessalonians, he indicates a number of signs that need to occur
in the "last days".  And there are many other reasons why the vast majority of
scholars reject the Pastorals as being authored by Paul.

But while we aren't dealing with Paul, we *are* dealing with letters
written by an early member of the Jesus movement.  For simplicity's sake, let's
call him Pseudo-Paul.  What does the purpose of this letter appear to be?  The
author was certainly familiar with other letters of Paul, often employing famous
pauline phrases, and Pseudo-Paul does an immense amount of name-dropping and
story creating to cast the illusion of an early letter from one leader in the
movement to another (both Paul and Timothy were probably long dead when this
letter was written).  He really wants these letters to be read as though Paul
wrote them.

The Context of 2 Timothy for this Scripture Mastery
---------------------------------------------------

The majority of the letters seem to be focused on the issue of doing
things *correctly.*  Turning specifically to 2 Timothy, Pseuo-Paul makes
reference to martial training and sports training and compares this to Timothy's
efforts to resist the challenges ahead of him.  Pseudo-Paul warns Timothy:

-   hold to correct words
-   protect that good thing entrusted to you
-   do not wrangle over words: it will bring ruin
-   avoid profane chatter
-   do not engage in heated disputes
-   avoid evil people
-   evil people and charlatans will go from bad to worse
-   preach the message whether or not its convenient
-   reprove, rebuke, and exhort
-   be self-controlled and endure hardship

It appears that the author wants his audience to follow this same
advice. Perhaps the community he lived in was experiencing severe internal
conflict. Perhaps he wants to do more than just say that his enemies in the
Christian movement are wrong: he wants *Paul* to say that they are wrong.
 Perhaps he could point to this letter and say, "We're in the last days, and Paul
warned us about people like you!"

In particular, the verses of this Scripture Mastery are a complete and
utter laundry list of every bad quality you could ascribe to a person.  The
historical Paul would have felt that these people were *already* present in the
world because this world is by it's nature evil, fallen, and under the
control of evil men and angels.  Pseudo-Paul warns Timothy to be ready for even worse
things. Notably he warns Timothy and Timothy's charges *personally*, without
much mention of how they should be passing this message on to others.
 Timothy should be ready for this stuff, because it's going to happen to *him*.
(He *does* mention how this is already affecting other Christians just a few
verses later, but [that will be its own post][].)

Often when modern readers approach the Bible they think it's a book
written for *us* in the 21st Century.  The Book of Mormon is really rather strong
in supporting this misguided idea, because some of the writers
actually *are* aware of their modern readers, and modern readers are explicitly told by LDS
Church leaders that the Book of Mormon was written *for them.*  The Bible is
not like this at all.  Nobody in it was writing for the *future* (mostly because
they thought there wouldn't *be* much of a future left), not even the author
of the Revelation of John.  Whatever Pseudo-Paul wanted to say with his
letter, it's not written to warn people in a long-distant time about what conditions
in the world would be like after nearly 1800 years.  Pseudo-Paul was writing
about his own day and age, possibly with specific enemies in mind.

Why Do I Think This Is Part of Scripture Mastery?
-------------------------------------------------

I think this scripture was chosen because it helps support the
apocalyptic perspective of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.  That
"Latter- day" means the last days, so Mormons believe that Pseudo-Paul is
describing their day and age.  However, the authorship is almost certainly a later
writer than Paul who was willing to use Paul's name and fame to advance their
own objectives.  There have been Christians thinking that their days are
the "last days" since at least the 400s; Mormons are not unique in this respect,
and frankly I'd not be surprised if there are pockets of Christian
communities 500 years from now that each believe that their day and age is at the end
of human history.  Mormons are not misusing this scripture, though, and so if
they want to keep it in Scripture Mastery I say more power to them.
