My Experience
-------------

<span class="alignright w300" markdown="1"> [![A classic case of Liahona vs Iron rod.][]][] </span>

When I was growing up in the Church, long before my crisis of faith and eventually
admitting I was an Exmormon, I discovered the famous
Liahona-Iron Rod belief labels. I loved the idea; I could instantly see in my mind where
the various adults and friends I had lined up between these two positions.
I was a Liahona Mormon, no question, and I could easily see most of my Seminary
teacher and other leaders as Iron Rodders. When I got older (probably in
college) I realized the limitations of this particular schema; it's actually too
limiting to place an individual into one of two groups. Everyone overlaps each
position in various aspects of their life. But I continued to use the term
because of its usefulness in providing a shorthand in discussions. "Liahona" may not
fully describe a person, but it describes enough to give a rough picture. The
same can be said for "Iron Rod".

<span class="alignleft w300" markdown="1"> ![LDS Chapel][] </span>

Since then I've found another separation used, with the same
limitations, in regards to how Mormons approach the difficulties of their religion
against modern science and scholarship: the Chapel (or traditional) Mormons and
the Internet (or non-traditional) Mormons. Unfortunately, these terms are
often applied by those who don't feel they belong in either group and have
some serious negative connotations. Unlike "Liahona" and "Iron Rod", the
Chapel- Traditional distinction is usually applied in a divisive fashion meant
to provide a negative view of another person. For this reason I try hard
to refrain from using it, but it also continues to provide a cool short-hand in
describing aspects of Mormon belief and approach.<!--more-->

<span class="alignright w180" markdown="1"> [![Outer Blogness][]][] </span>

In recent years, for various reasons, I have decided that I no longer
believe the truth claims of the LDS Church. I was mentally a NOM for a while,
but the mental difficulties of trying to support half of the truth claims of
the Church without supporting the other half was a tiring exercise that ultimately
was not sustainable for me. So I finally bit the bullet and accepted myself as
an Exmormon. Around this time I found my browsing habits pulling naturally
away from the traditional "Bloggernacle" towards the famous sites of the
"Outer Blogness" (I love those names). Reading about others who had left the
Church, some only mentally and others fully, filled me with a sense of
camaraderie that I had been missing since I decided I no longer really "belonged" with
my fellow Latter-day Saints. Most of these blogs approached the Church with a
sense of caution and respect. Acid and flames were certainly given towards the
very real failings and weaknesses of the Church. There exist many doctrines and
practices within the LDS Church that are emotionally and mentally harmful to
individuals, especially those who are effectively second-class citizens of "Zion":
women, children, homosexuals, intellectuals, feminists, etc. But, on the other
hand, most of these individuals were also able to give a textual "high-five"
to what they saw as successes for the Church. Even in the midst of the
difficulty of leaving---losing friends, family, respect---there was still an attempt
to be objective about the subject.

I thought that this objective approach was the norm. I figured that most
people who came to their beliefs through rationality and critical thinking
would continue to apply that critical thinking towards their now lack of
belief. I thought that people who had realized that most of their faith as a LDS
was based on emotion would realize the dangers of continuing to depend on
emotion. Just as many who left the Church held serious and honest beliefs before they
left, so too was it often assumed that those who remained probably held similar
honest beliefs that had simply not been closely examined. (And even now, I
find the idea that all people within the Church *don't* rationally examine their
beliefs to be far too simplistic; many do and still do not leave. I refuse to
categorize them as simpletons or just plain evil. It can't always be that simple.
Maybe for some, but I agree with [Kathryn Schulz][]: that's probably just a mental
coping mechanism to explain why others
don't believe the way I do when they have similar data. It's important to
reserve judgment toward myself that I *still* might be wrong about everything.
I feel that certainty of any kind is dangerous, even a certainty that the
truth claims of the LDS Church are false. I reserve the unlikely possibility that,
given further evidence, I might have to one day change my opinion one way or
another.)

<span class="alignright w294" markdown="1"> [![I am an Exmormon][]][] </span>

One of the major helps in coming to terms with leaving the Church was
the YouTube series ["I am an Exmormon."][] More than simply a response to the
LDS Church's media campaign ("I am a Mormon")
these videos were heartfelt expressions of people who finally were able to
find peace, happiness, and mental stability by leaving the Church. Those
interviewed rarely showed hatred toward their former faith, but rather expressed
that in acknowledging the failings of the LDS Church they had found the ability
to fully discover who they were. The Church had provided a lot for them and they
had grown as much as they could within it, but in leaving they were
unhindered from developing even further. They are a beautiful series because they
present a view of Exmormons that contradicts entirely that cultural view fostered
within the Church of those who leave: instead of angry, they are hopeful; instead
of bitter, they are calmer; instead of obsessed, they are loving. Those
videos speak a wonderful truth: you can leave the Church and not leave who you
are behind. You can retain the good within yourself because that good is
not a product of the Church. It may have been fostered by the Church, but in
truth the good within you is your own to take with you wherever you wish to go in
life.

<span class="alignleft w300" markdown="1"> ![Angry Family][] </span>

That's what I had hoped for in the Exmormon community. And, truth be
told, I saw it in a number of individuals. Are you hurting because you've been
abandoned, rejected, or misunderstood by your family and friends? Many will open
their arms towards you in love; many of them have gone through the same thing. Are
you still in the closet, dealing with frustration and anger? Again, so many
people are out there who understand you and can help you through it. For a
long time I thought that the infamous rejective phrase was unfair: of course people
can't leave it alone! They have friends and family who are still within the
Church. You can't simply cut those ties; it's impossible. And for so many TBMs
the Church is part of everyday life. It comes up at work, home, and (of
course) Church. It's difficult for them to know to avoid the subject around
friends and family who no longer believe. So, duh! Of *course* some people can't
leave it alone. But I've found that there are some for whom this way of looking
at "not leaving it alone" isn't the entire story.

<span class="alignright w125" markdown="1"> ![The Facts][] </span>

It's one thing to discuss facts; facts are discrete points. They can be
debated, certainly, but on the whole they are usually not the object of
discussion or debate themselves. Joseph Smith married multiple women, some of them
already married to other men. The Book of Mormon contains chiastic structures.
DNA evidence for the ancestry of the indigenous peoples of the Americas
indicates they originated in Siberia and Central Asia through successive
migrations beginning possibly as early as 25,000 years ago. There is a location in
Saudi Arabia called NHM that has been in existence since at least 600 CE. The
length of the scroll of Hôr was most probably only 150 cm long. These are
simply facts; they exist apart from any theories. They do not have to say anything in
and of themselves. There may be some disturbing implications that extend from
them, but they are not, in and of themselves, arguments.

<span class="alignleft w298" markdown="1"> ![The Great Debate][] </span>

And yet I occasionally see people maligned and belittled who attempt to
bring up facts that *could* be used in arguments that support Mormonism's truth
claims, and I also see facts that could be used in arguments against truth
claims used *as* arguments that somehow are supposed to *mean* something. That
would be fine, but there is often a sense of decency and respect that appears
absent to me. I could easily be wrong, but it often appears that some Exmormons
feel justified in not being civil because we often receive anything **but**
civility from many TBMs. However, the rules of a debate are not decided within
the conversation itself. That's Fox News crap: let the loudest win and keep
the rules changing faster than your opponent can keep up. That's not about
discussion and understanding: it's about *winning*.

And I have to admit that I just don't get it, if that's really the case
(and it may not be; that's just how it looks to me). I don't understand it. I
*know* it can be different. I know many Exmormons who deal differently. However,
even knowing that doesn't mean that the people I don't understand are
*wrong*. It just means that I don't understand them. So, after a lot of thought,
and in an attempt to be fair and promote understanding, I propose a new
classification, this time of ourselves---the Exmormons. And the best way I can think of
to do so is to use two films that are both awesome and exciting. So I propose
the distinction between the **Matrix Exmos** and the **Inception Exmos**.
Obviously any allegory or comparison will break down if you extend it too far, so
let me explain it as far as I think it can go.

Matrix Exmormon
---------------

> **Tools of Choice:** *Under the Banner of Heaven*, *An Insider's Guide to
>  Mormon Origins*, *The Book of Mammon*, or anything that, while it strives to
>  be accurate, is also hard-hitting and direct about the issues.

<span class="alignright w252" markdown="1"> ![The Matrix][] </span>

In the Matrix, humanity is enslaved in a particularly devious form of
mind control by the machines who are exploiting them for their own purposes.
However, while humanity as a whole doesn't even realize that they are being
exploited and kept from the truth of their world, a small group of people who have
been "unplugged" exist in a war against the machines in the hope of one day
bringing down the Matrix and freeing humanity to live a life that is truly free
from control. There's also a bunch of silly stuff like mechwarrior
exoskeletons and an overabundance of trenchcoats, but on the whole that's the idea: a
war between men and machines over the freedom of human minds. So, for the Matrix
Exmormon the parallels are clear: the LDS Church exists because of the faithful
support of its members; and the faith of the members is a faith both in a
false worldview as well as in a dangerous set of principles. Mormonism denies
full equality to women and has a history, not yet fully eradicated nor
repudiated, of racism. The LDS Church consistently refuses to apologize for the crimes
caused by its own inflamed rhetoric of the past (such as the Mountain Meadows
Massacre) and refuses to acknowledge fault in the actions of its members today in
actions that are cruel and bigoted towards many of the minorities of our
society such as homosexuals and immigrants.

<span class="alignleft w300" markdown="1"> ![Matrix Pods][] </span>

It spends billions on private ventures such as the City Creek Center and
most of the top officials received "stipends" that mirror the salaries pulled
in by heads of major corporations; meanwhile the amount spent on humanitarian
aid worldwide over their entire history is a pathetic fraction of the
amount the Church has spent in the past decade alone. Yet the Church continues to
present itself as a champion to the poor and afflicted throughout the world.
Their vast financial holding give them tremendous economic power in the Western US
and the united actions of their members gives them tremendous political and
cultural power, as seen in the involvement of LDS members in California's
Proposition 8 decision; it is unlikely that LDS members would have mobilized with
anything near the strength of cash and activism seen if church authorities in
Salt Lake City had not actively encouraged it. The LDS Church, as an
organization, donated very little to Prop 8 efforts, but instead asked for, and got without
much question, the support of the members.

<span class="alignright w300" markdown="1"> ![Zion Battle][] </span>

In the Matrix, the freedom fighters from Zion are engaged in constant
battle with the machines. Every soul unplugged from the prison of the Matrix
is a benefit, but the end goal is not to free everyone individually but
instead to take down the seemingly monolithic organization of the machines and
destroy the Matrix itself. For Matrix Exmormons, the end goal is not just to help
individuals out of the Church, but to demolish the seemingly vast power
that the Church currently controls by destroying the system of false beliefs
they use to keep the members in line. And, just as in a war, the stakes are high.
Facts and the arguments that employ them are not tools but weapons. Is someone
starting to doubt the Church? Explain to them about Kinderhook, about Mountain
Meadows, or the full extent of the Temple ban for blacks. Did the person listen?
Yes? Then congrats, another human saved from slavery. No? Well, that just goes to
show the level of control the Morg holds over its people. What about the hidden
history, the financial dealings, the intellectual purges? The Church claims to
be the only true church, but it's not. The leaders probably know this; they
actively hide and distort. They employ their apologists to defend the claims
with tenuous findings and reasoning and then use their influence to keep members
from noticing. That's why it's okay if I'm a little sloppy in how I present
my arguments, if I get my facts a little bit wrong: they do it too! This
is war, man. Just as in the film, there is no middle ground. Those who attempt
to work with the machines are nothing better than traitors. The end goal is
what matters! This about freedom and slavery; there is no middle ground. The
Church is unethical and corrupt, through and through. The reason that members
of the Church are told not to trust Exmormons is because the leaders know the
weaknesses we can present. They know the danger we pose to them. It's
all about the power, the control, or the tithing. When the Church tells the young
men to get married early, the ultimate goal is tithing. The religion and the
beliefs are the tools to keep the members in line. I don't care if I offend
people in the Church by what I say; it just proves that they're not ready to
acknowledge the truth yet. I don't have to take a moral high ground against an
organization that is evil and/or unethical.

I'm probably getting into the realm of parody, so I should probably stop
here. Suffice it to say, while I'm trying to represent the views I see
expressed online, I'm probably not doing a very good job because I am not a
Matrix Exmormon. I'm an Inception Exmormon.

Inception Exmormon
------------------

> **Tools of Choice:** *Guns, Germs, and Steel*; *1491*; *Who Wrote the
>  Bible?*; or anything else that doesn't explicitly discuss the Church but
>  instead lays a foundation for personal introspection about the Church's

<span class="alignright w300" markdown="1"> ![Inception][] </span>

The film Inception does not adapt itself as well to the struggle of how
an Exmormon deals with the LDS Church and its members. In Inception a
small group of specialists who usually steal secrets from other people through
their dreams are instead employed to try and plant an idea within another person.
However, this "inception" of an idea has never successfully been accomplished
before since individuals can usually recognize when the thought is not their
own and reject it. Through the film, the team prepares for the inception by
preparing intricately assembled dream-world through which they will take the
target in an attempt to plant the idea subtly enough that the target will view the
idea as their own. Of course, it doesn't go quite that smoothly, there are a
lot of action shots, bizarre examples of dreamworld physics, and the threat of
being lost in limbo. None of that really applies here, but the basic idea of
the inception of an idea does.

<span class="alignleft w300" markdown="1"> ![Inception Snow][] </span>

To an Inception Exmormon, there is no vast organized conspiracy keeping
those who believe in the Church in line. The Church is a product of itself.
Perhaps there are some leaders and authorities who realize that the Church is
not true, but on the whole the decisions and actions made by the Church are made
by members who believe the truth claims. The nefariousness is not
conscious, but is rather and accident of the Church's corporate structure and the
corporate structure is itself an accident of attempts to organize the Church over
the past century of growth. The LDS Church has problems. Its beliefs caused
pain, damage, and limitations to its members and other people. Whatever the origins
of the Church, whether or not Joseph Smith saw himself as a prophet or knew
himself as a regular human, these questions are irrelevant to the Church today. It
is true that most of the truth claims themselves currently depend on the
authenticity of Joseph Smith as a prophet, but the behavior and actions of the Church
today are expressed through people who have all been born in the 20th and 21st
Centuries. While there are plenty of people who would be willing to pull the
trigger if asked, there is nobody left alive today who was at Mountain Meadows and
nobody today can bear the direct blame for the actions perpetrated there. The
problem is that a Mountain Meadows, while unlikely, is certainly possible if it
were requested by a high authority within the Church. And that is a problem
that *can* be dealt with without the destruction of the LDS Church as an
organization. There are other branches of the Latter Day Saint movement
who have overcome many of the problematic issues caused by the Salt Lake church
and it is not impossible that a future Salt Lake Church might look more like the
Community of Christ looks today. For an Inception Exmormon, it's all about the
well-placed idea. Fix the church through many well-placed ideas. Support those
active members who have overcome the mental problems that plague most other
members. Emphasize grace, emphasize environmentalism, emphasis egalitarianism,
renounce war and proclaim peace. Close the malls and open the homeless shelters.
While not likely, change is possible.

<span class="alignright w300" markdown="1"> ![Inception Pinwheel][] </span>

The same is true of the individual who might leave the Church. An
Inception Exmormon understands that leaving the Church, as it currently exists,
is probably the best decision for *most* Mormons (though not *all*
Mormons; some might be better benefited by remaining); at least until the doctrines
and practices change enough to soften the ills that the Church can cause.
As with dealing with change in the Church, causing change with another person
is accomplished through the well-placed idea. Presenting someone who is
struggling with their faith with strong examples of the Church's falsity
rarely accomplishes anything (though I need to acknowledge that it might on
rare occasion). Just as in the film, people tend to reject an idea that
isn't theirs. Helping someone out of the Church requires working with them on their
level, whatever that level happens to be. There is no magic bullet; you cannot
just present the Book of Abraham and watch the scales fall from their eyes.
There are plenty of people who remain within the Church who know all of the dirt.
They can handle the dissonance. The only real change can come individually from
within by acknowledging the possibility that the Church might not be true. If you
present data that is not entirely accurate then those bits of inaccurate data
can be enough to cling to to reject the real facts that were presented.
Attacking the individual's tribe by mistreating friends or trusted figures like GAs
and missionaries will only tighten the bond the individual has towards his
or her tribe. Instead the idea of the Church's falsehood must be presented
carefully, honestly, and above all without an appeal to emotion. Telling someone
how the Utah Boys Ranch is a terrible place (it is) and is actively populated
through the efforts of stake and area leaders (it is) and then talking about
how evil the LDS Church is for supporting such a horrible place is not
going to accomplish anything. You cannot deal in such absolutes; telling someone
that the Church is unethical for such-and-such just sets up a debate for why
you're wrong.

<span class="alignleft w288" markdown="1"> ![Inception Target][] </span>

Admitting that your opinion of the Church is negative because of
such-and-such is a way of verbally telling them that they can hold a differing
opinion and allows you to state the facts that back up your opinion or argument in
a way that the facts themselves can be accepted as being true (because they
are) and allows the individual to evaluate them for themselves (and, possibly,
"incept" the idea to them of the Church's inability to explain the facts as they
stand). It is not a war, and the default position to take with everyone is a
cautious position of assuming honest intentions. You can assume that Church
leaders are encouraging young men to get married because they are concerned for
their eternal welfare, and you can also assume that they're simply concerned
about the Church's bottom line of tithing income. Either way the results would
appear the same, but one requires the devious actions of people focused on money
and the other allows for people to be making honest decisions in line with the
belief structure. Tithing money is the Lord's money and having more of it just
means that the Church can accomplish the will of God that much better. It's
easier to delineate battle lines between good and evil, or between rational and
illogical, but humanity is more complicate than that. We are hard-wired through
millions of years of organic and social evolution to belief in irrational things.
The ultimate opponent for an Inception Exmormon is not the LDS Church but
rather the genetic and social constructs that are no longer necessary in our
modern culture. The war waged is not between artificial constructs like good
and evil or corruption and ethics, but is rather a war within the minds of
individual people to help train them in avenues of critical thinking to come to
their own conclusions.

Limitations
-----------

I can guess what a few of you might be saying: the Inception Exmormon
sounds a lot like a TBM to me. They "lie for the Lord", they only tell what they
want to in order to further their goals. Inception Exmormons are willing to
allow some falsehoods to continue in an uncertain attempt to help just one person.
There are thousands who need help, who are stagnating and stuck; we can't go
one at a time. And I don't feel the need to treat the Church with the same
respect I'd give, say, the Episcopalians (or perhaps all religions are undeserving
of objectivity). At least the Episcopalians are advancing social change;
the Mormons do nothing to advance humanity.

Well, this is less of an invitation for everyone to be Inception Exmos
and simply more of an observation of where I stand (and have seen others
stand) verses where the majority seems to be. It strikes me as the response to
seeing a spider in the home: you can kill it on sight with a single mighty kick,
or you can put it under a cup and paper and carry it outside. Either way the
goal is the same; and so it is with the Matrix Exmos and the Inception Exmos.
I'm not sure how effective it is to argue that one approach is "better" than
another for everyone. Certainly one approach is better for a particular individual.
But the important thing in the long run is to acknowledge that the other side
exists and to tolerate them. I cannot see myself, with who I am right now, being a
Matrix Exmo. I dislike looking at the debate that way (which is probably why
that side of the analogy needs a lot of work from someone who feels that way and
can be fair to the viewpoint in ways I cannot be), but I do understand that
some people think it's better to just rip the band-aid off all at once. Open the
blinds! Roll down the windows! I may not agree with the methods (I don't see it
as two side battling against each other, but just humans acting like humans),
but I hope I can understand the underlying purpose: to help people. As long
as I can keep that in mind I can tolerate Matrix Exmos. I may not like them
much, but I cannot claim that they are wrong in their intentions.  But trust me,
[I understand][] the pain, the guilt, the grief that LDS beliefs can cause.

<span class="alignright w300" markdown="1"> ![Truce][] </span>

Obviously this distinguishing needs some help on the Matrix side. 
I'd appreciate what I got right and what I got wrong (probably most of it);
please understand that I meant well about a point of view I find difficult
to comprehend.  I need your assistance to clean it up properly.  And I'd
also be curious as to how many who would see themselves as Matrix Exmos (if I
got the analogy wrong or overly stereotyped, you know what I meant by the
viewpoint, right?  Just pretend I said things the correct way and go with that)
who saw themselves as Iron-Rodders or Liahonas when they were TBMs.  And the
same for Inception Exmos, where were you before it all came tumbling down or all
finally became clear (to put it in a positive light)?  I have my suspicions
(Matrix = Iron Rod, Inception = Liahona), but I could be so very, very wrong of
course. It could be that there's no equal divide between two points of view but
rather than one view is a precursor that some hold before they move to the
other view (but which comes first and which comes second and can they keep
switching back and forth?).  I'm very interested in things like that.  Are you?
