Usually my process on these posts is to step back in time, in my head,
to my own  
days in Seminary about fifteen years ago.  Of course, this can't take
into  
account any change in LDS culture or doctrine since then (and some LDS
doctrines  
and cultural assumptions have shifted dramatically in the past twenty
years),  
but it tends to provide a good starting off point for what I want to
talk about.

However, in this case I remember distinctly being taught that this set
of verses  
was *Important* (with a capital "I") because it taught something that
other  
Christians didn't believe.  My hazy memory seemed to pull up a sense
that other  
Christians didn't believe in the resurrection of the body, or that
perhaps they  
felt that Jesus himself wasn't resurrected but was a spirit.  However,
in the  
intervening years I've made it my business to learn the general
Christian  
viewpoints (mostly the main Protestant viewpoints) on the Godhead; I've
made it  
my business to try and understand the theological underpinnings of
basic  
Trinitarian doctrine.  And I can't think of many Christians who
actually deny  
the resurrection of the body (though most simply view it as an odd side
doctrine  
of Christianity without much importance), and I can't think
of *any* Christians  
who deny the bodily resurrection of Jesus as described in some of the
Gospels.  
I must have been mistaken.

So I asked my wife, who did not grow up in Utah, what she remembers
about this  
scripture from her Seminary days.  "Hmm," she said, thinking back, "I
seem to  
remember being told that this scripture specifically refutes the idea
that Jesus  
doesn't have a body.  But that can't be right, can it?  Because I don't
think  
most Christians have any idea whether or not Jesus kept his body after
he was  
resurrected and I think even less care about the idea."

So, on the basis of a memory of Seminary from both Utah and Colorado
during the  
late 90s, I'm going to assume that this idea was common in CES at the
time:  
Luke's depiction of Christ's physical resurrection was important to
Mormons *in  
context of the beliefs of other Christians*.

Turning to other sources, it seems that this idea may have its genesis
with  
Elder LeGrand Richard's book *A Marvelous Work and a Wonder* which was
in the  
missionary library before and while I was on my mission (but has since
been  
dropped from the recommended books for all missionaries).  Elder
Richards uses  
this verse to combat an idea he feels is found in traditional
Christianity,  
namely that God is "everywhere and nowhere, without body, parts, or
passions."  
Of course, this is a conception of God believed by *some, *but nowhere
near  
*all,* Christians towards God *the* *Father*, and not Jesus.  I think
the only  
reason that Elder Richards felt that this verse was a correct
refutation of this  
idea of God being without a body is because Elder Richards *also* seems
to think  
that a Trinitarian viewpoint of God and Jesus has them being the same
person,  
which it does not.  Believing that the Father, the Son, and the Holy
Ghost are  
merely three expression of a single being is actually a Christian
heresy called  
Modalism or Sabelleanism.  The Trinity occupies a mentally difficult
place  
between the heresy of Modalism and the heresy of polytheism, walking
the knife's  
edge between the two.  Many Christians feel a deep sense of holy
mystery about  
how the nature of God is both expressed in three persons perfectly
united in one  
Godhood.  This sense of holy mystery is not absent from Mormonism; I've
found  
its best example is applied towards the exact mechanics of how
Christ's  
Atonement, localized to a specific few hours in time and a single spot
in space,  
can have an impact that is universal in both time and space.  Mormons
don't just  
accept that as a mystery: they feel a deep sense of profundity at how
it's  
incomprehensible to them.  There are few things that bother me more
than hearing  
Mormons mocking the mystery of Trinity and mere minutes later
expressing their  
wonder and amazement at how the Atonement surpasses understanding.

So I think it's a fundamental misunderstanding of traditional Christian
theology  
and Trinitarianism that makes Elder Richards feel that this verse is
well-suited  
to be used against such beliefs.  After all, if the Father and the Son
are the  
same being, then how can God be without "body, parts, or passions" and
yet  
Christ *obviously* has a body here in this verse?  Q.E.D., right?

But that's all in the past: part of my childhood.  Perhaps we've moved
on from  
this sort of thinking, right?  Let's see what the current manuals have
to say on  
this subject.

The "current" Institute manual (which is *woefully* out of date in its
biblical  
scholarship, its quotations of old LDS general authorities, and its
social  
applications) is actually, somewhat surprisingly, rather silent on
this  
particular section, preferring instead to focus on issues of the
authority and  
priesthood of the apostles through what are apparently "meaningful
silences" in  
the text by the authors in this story of Jesus appearing to them after
his  
resurrection.

The Seminary materials, on the other hand, focus much more on how
students  
should learn about the doctrine of resurrection *in general* from this
passage  
and its context (yay for context!  Student are actually *encouraged* to
read  
further after this scripture to see that Luke's resurrected Jesus eats
and  
drinks food).  Of course, other scriptures on this subject are also
brought up  
which might muddy the waters and imply more about this verse than what
it says  
on its own.  But I am glad to report that the official manuals only use
these  
scriptures to further discussion of resurrection and what resurrected
bodies  
"are like".

Now, from my post-Mormon perspective, I'm glad that it appears that the  
scripture is no longer seen as useful in defending Mormon beliefs.
 Frankly,  
this scripture is actually rather useless in upholding any of the
rather  
distinct doctrines of Mormonism, either those doctrines about
resurrection or  
about an embodied God.  Mormon believe that resurrection
is *forever, *and that  
it is impossible for a resurrected person to "put off" their body.
 Except when  
some of them make exceptions against this permanence in the 19th
Century and  
beyond in trying to account for Brigham Young's bizarre conception of
Adam as  
the re-embodiment of God the Father.  These ideas of physical bodies
being  
"taken up" and "put aside" continue to pop up in hushed conversation
and private  
gatherings as part of the "meat" of the Gospel and some of the "deep
doctrines"  
that "everyone" knows about (I speak from experience, having heard some
of this  
from multiple individuals as various times).  Frankly, I think most
Christians  
feel that Jesus, being God, cannot and should not be viewed as limited
in any of  
his power and actions and that if Jesus wishes to have a body, then he
can have  
a body, and if he wishes to put that body aside for a while, then he
can do so.  
Because HE'S GOD, right?

And it's even more bizarre that this scripture, about the resurrected
Jesus,  
would have anything to do with the nature of God the Father.  Mormons
believe  
that the Father is embodied just as the Son is embodied (though they
have just  
as much confusion and lack of interest in the Holy Ghost as many
Christians do),  
and while this doctrine provides much religious angst between some
Mormons and  
some Christians, the nature of the Father is not illuminated in any
way, shape,  
or form by this verse.  Luke's Jesus never says, "Oh, and by the way,
my body  
looks like my father's.  Just FYI."  John's Jesus may make such
statements, but  
John's Gospel is, as they say, a horse of an entirely different color.

Moving on to another issue, Jesus's statement that "a spirit" doesn't
have flesh  
and bone should be analyzed.  From a Mormon point of view, this
statement has  
sometimes gained a particular importance in light of things said by
Brigham  
Young and other 19th Century leaders.  Supposedly, it's noteworthy that
Luke  
doesn't have Jesus say that he doesn't have "flesh and blood", because  
resurrected bodies don't have blood.  Well, let me here and now state:
I  
sincerely doubt that Luke would have made such a nuanced theological
statement  
in the middle of his passion narrative, and that's assuming that the
historical  
Luke is even the actual author of the Gospel of Luke and Acts of the
Apostles  
(which has numerous reasons to be unlikely; the same author wrote both
books,  
but it's doubtful that his name, or even possibly *her* name, was
"Luke").  
Also, the words in question are literally "fleshes" and "bones".  Flesh
in this  
context means the squishy, meaty, bloody stuff that a body is made of.
 Blood is  
very much included in the sense of the word.  Basically, the verse is
stating  
quite clearly just how very physical the body of Jesus is: it has bones
and  
squishy stuff.  It doesn't just *look* physical, it *is* physical.  The
lack of  
mentioning blood isn't an oversight, but rather just a perfectly valid
way of  
saying that Jesus's body is make of flesh and bone (and, by negation, a
spirit  
is *not* made of such things).

For some Christians who feel that the Bible must be viewed as an
inerrant whole  
(including Mormons, who tend to be inerrantists except where the Bible
is either  
obviously wrong or where it conflicts with LDS theology), the use by
Luke of  
"flesh and bone" instead of "flesh and blood" helps resolve a number of
issues  
found outside of Luke's gospel.  In Matthew 16:17, a previous scripture
mastery  
scripture for instance, Jesus says that Simon was told that Jesus is
the Christ  
by Jesus's Father and *not* by flesh and blood.  And Paul in 1
Corinthians 15:50  
says that "flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of god."  All of
which  
would imply that God, and all in the kingdom of God, are without flesh
and  
blood.  But Christians in general believe in the resurrection of the
body, and  
Mormons particularly believe that physical resurrection is permanent
and that  
even God the Father has a resurrected body (except when they don't, as
we've  
said).  So the resolution is that resurrected bodies do not have blood.
 This is  
an explanation found outside of Mormonism, too (though it is
relatively  
uncommon).

My solution?  Paul is not the author of Luke-Acts, and the author of
Luke-Acts  
is not the author of Matthew, and it took centuries for a coherent and  
consistent theology to develop among the followers of Jesus.  I think
using  
Luke's account to imply some sort of scientific theory of the bloodless
state of  
resurrected bodies is more than a little bizarre, and makes about as
much sense  
as explaining how Leia told Luke she remembered her mother's face being
sad in  
*Return of the Jedi*, when her mother died during childbirth
in *Revenge of the  
Sith*, though an appeal to the *Star Wars* trilogy of books written by
Timothy  
Zahn.  Are they all about *Star Wars?* Yes, but you're just going to
have  
problems if you view all of them as being consistent with themselves
and each  
other, even though they're all "official" Lucasfilm stories because
while the  
authors might have been aware of each other they weren't working
together.  The  
biblical Luke's statement here simply has a particular dramatic flair
that isn't  
found in other similar works, but to assume that his
statement *must* be read in  
concert with other, separate writers is unfair to both Luke and those
other  
writers.

Why Do I Think This Is Part of Scripture Mastery?
-------------------------------------------------

I think this verse's presence in the Scripture Mastery list is a relic
of  
history that has been left behind officially (although I have no idea
if it's  
been left behind in practice by most Seminary and Institute teachers
and  
wouldn't be surprised to see if it's still very much alive in a
continuing oral  
tradition).  I think that from the perspective of the 2010's seminary
program,  
this particular verse has lost its purpose.  I would not be surprised
in the  
least to see it dropped from any future re-assembling of "Scripture
Mastery"  
lists that might be proposed.  When the current Scripture Mastery list
was first  
created, somebody felt, based on ideas popular at the time among Church
leaders  
such as LeGrand Richards, that this was a *great* scripture to use
against the  
general strawman conception of Trinitarianism and against the idea of
God the  
Father being a spirit.  In the intervening years, this usage has
become  
increasingly obvious as a mistaken interpretation of both the scripture
itself  
and of general Christian views, and so focus has instead focused on
the  
physicality of Jesus's resurrection to try and impress upon LDS youth
how the  
doctrine of resurrection is a physical one (though I doubt most LDS
youth would  
know that physical resurrection is believed in by Christians but is
usually just  
viewed as a curiosity and not of much attention).
