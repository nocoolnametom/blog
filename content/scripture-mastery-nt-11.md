##### Update May 2013

*This scripture has been removed by the Church Educational System from
the  
Scripture Mastery list. However, it had remained within this list for
over two  
decades and as such is still familiar to many graduates of the LDS
Church's  
Seminary program. So I'm keeping this exploration of it online, but it
is no  
longer applicable to CES.*

The Context: Stephen's Martyrdom in Acts
----------------------------------------

We're back to an author we've seen before!  The book of Acts is unique
in the  
New Testament: it is the only sequel.  The author of Acts is the same
person as  
the author of the Gospel of Luke.  Luke is often the favorite
evangelist of  
people to read: he likes to focus on people and stories instead of on
dense  
sermons and dialogs.  And here in Acts it is no different.  The verses
in  
question are not part of a sermon delivered on the nature of God, but
are in  
fact the last words of a long, emotional exposition on Jewish history,
delivered  
by the movement's (apparently) first martyr (not counting Jesus).

In the Book of Acts, the main character is no longer Jesus, who has
ascended  
into heaven, but is rather the Holy Spirit, who is the main mover and
motivator  
of the many stories.  The entire book is about how the good news of
Jesus the  
Messiah's death spreads from a small group of followers in Jerusalem
and Galilee  
to many cities in Greece and Asia minor (modern-day Turkey).  It's
split up into  
two parts, the first is the story of Peter and how the "way" (Luke's
name for  
the movement that seems to be the original Christian term for their
diverse  
movement) endured through the initial growing pains of being led by
human beings  
into new areas of the world both physically and theologically (though
there's  
some good evidence that Luke is cleaning up the complexities of the
real history  
he's covering and simplifying the story considerably), and the second
is how the  
conversion of a bitter enemy, Saul of Tarsus, leads the movement to the
Gentiles  
and eventually to the whole world.  The verses in question comes from
the first  
part of the work.  Peter and the other apostles have elected seven men
to help  
them administer the needs to the young movement so that they can be
free to  
preach as missionaries.  However, these seven men quickly become
preachers and  
missionaries themselves, so it's unclear to me how well this plan was
thought  
out.

The martyr is Stephen (a Greek name, perhaps a glimpse of an early
Gentile  
convert to the movement before the traditional start as related by Luke
where  
Peter is given a vision of unclean animals he is told to eat), who has
just  
finished telling the Jewish leaders how wicked they are and how they
are  
following a pattern of wickedness throughout their history that has led
up to  
their crucifying Jesus even though he fits into this pattern of their
history as  
well and that they are murderers and lawbreakers because of it.  (The
sermons  
that Luke gives to his main characters in much of Acts are really
quite  
inflammatory texts, so it's little wonder that the speakers keep having
trouble  
with their audience.) He then proclaims that he sees Jesus in vision
with God,  
and the crowd are so incensed that they decide to stone Stephen to
death on the  
spot.

Jewish leaders did not have the authority to kill Judeans without Roman  
approval.  This is usually given in Sunday School as the explanation
for why  
Pilate, the Roman procurator of Judea, was involved in the sentencing
and  
execution of Jesus (and indeed that was probably why the Romans were
involved,  
but if so, we've lost record of what Jesus's crime against Rome
actually *was)*.  
But here in this story we have the Jews killing someone without any
apparent  
legal problems.  Perhaps one of the executions, of Jesus and of
Stephen, didn't  
occur as written, then?  Perhaps in the case of Stephen's death this
story of  
the leaders of the Jews executing Stephen for blasphemy is based on
early  
traditions of Christ followers being beaten up and killed by vigilante
mobs or  
other, less authoritative groups than the Sanhedrin of the Jews.
 Perhaps Luke  
wants to express the violent trouble that early Jesus followers were
having and  
so he takes the historical martyr Stephen and turns his story into an
somewhat  
mythologized, exemplary tale of early Christian martyrdom and
persecution that  
*many* unnamed people faced.  There's no way to know, of course.  It's
all  
supposition, but Luke is not what we in the 21st Century would consider
a  
"historian," but is more of a propagandist.  He's using history as a
tool to  
express his message.

Also note that we are given a glimpse into the last, inner moments of
Stephen.  
We aren't just told *what* he said he saw before the crowd decides to
kill him,  
we are told what he *saw* before he died.  Of course, it's the exact
same thing  
that he said he saw, but Luke as narrator gives us a view of Stephen's
vision  
that nobody else could have seen.  Since the author of Luke-Acts,
whoever he (or  
possibly she) was, never claims to divine revelation as one of their
sources, we  
can assume that this vision of Stephen's has some artistic perspective
applied  
to it (and even if the historical Luke who is traditionally viewed as
author  
wrote it, he was an ancient doctor and convert to the movement and not
an  
apostle or other source with divine authority, just a historian).  Did
Stephen  
really say what he thought he saw at the end of his sermon?  Were his
words  
accurately conveyed through the intervening decades between his death
and the  
writing of Acts?  Who kept the tradition alive all of those years, and
how much  
did the story grow or change during that time?  And above all, how
strongly  
should we view Stephen's vision as we have it in Acts 7 as a statement
of  
doctrinal importance?

LDS Views
---------

But anyways, enough of the context and questions (though I could
literally go on  
for a thousand more words about the book of Acts, which is without a
doubt one  
of my favorite New Testament works as even the author can't scrub out
the  
messiness of humanity evident in the small group of Jesus followers he
is  
chronicling).  Why was this scripture chosen by CES for LDS youth to
study and  
memorize to help them throughout the rest of their lives?  Well, on the
surface,  
this appears to be a scripture that fully supports the idea of the
now-risen  
Jesus as a divine figure.  Stephen proclaims to the Jews around him
that his  
spiritual leader, the executed Rabbi Jesus, is now set next to God
himself.  
Stephen is proclaiming the power and authority of Jesus in the coming
Kingdom of  
God, which, more than anything it seems, incenses Luke's villains who
then agree  
to kill him.  So it seems to be a scripture supporting Jesus as God's
divine  
messenger, and would thus be a perfectly appropriate scripture in
Christian and  
LDS theology, except that we've already covered other scriptures that
would say  
as much and there are other more-famous New Testament scriptures that
are *not*  
part of the scripture mastery list that also say as much.

So it seems that for Mormons, again, this scripture says so much more.
 Mormons  
in Seminary and Institute usually interpret Stephen's proclamation
literally:  
Stephen actually saw Jesus standing on the right side of God.  In other
words,  
Stephen saw two people: Jesus and God, and they were next to each
other.  Jesus  
is even identified as standing on the right-hand side of God.  So
Stephen saw  
*two people,* just like Joseph Smith claimed to see in (one of the
accounts of)  
his First Vision.  And God must have been visible, and not some
mysterious  
spirit, because Stephen saw him enough to know that it was God and that
Jesus  
was standing *next* to him.  Ergo, this is a vision that confirms the
rather  
non-traditional LDS idea of an embodied God the Father and speaks
against the  
(again, completely mistaken) idea of the Trinity being a Modalist God.
 This  
popular narrative that the LDS viewpoint helps illuminate aspects of
the Bible  
that have confused regular Christians for millennia arises yet again
(I'd love  
to talk about this rather arrogant viewpoint when it comes to the
baptism of  
Jesus, where it usually reaches it's most appalling mockery, and will
perhaps do  
some once I am finished with this Scripture Mastery series).  Because
obviously,  
if more Christians just *read* their Bible they'd see this stuff,
right? (The  
same could be said of hyper-patriotic American Mormons reading their
Book of  
Mormon, though, to be fair.  If they read it closer they'd see that
it's not  
nearly the pro-American, pro-Democracy work they often purport it to
be.)

Other Perspectives
------------------

So what are we to make of the common LDS perspective?  Is it valid?
 Yes, it is  
valid.  From a literal perspective, much (though not all) of this view
holds.  
Of course, this scripture says nothing about whether the Father (or
even the  
Son) has a body, and as we've discussed before, the usual Mormon idea
of the  
Christian Trinity is actually heretical itself, and is called Modalism
and while  
many average Christians might subconsciously adhere to it or even teach
it, it  
was denounced as a heresy even before the Arian controversy in the 4th
Century.  
But you can validly read it as a statement of Stephen seeing two
individuals  
next to each other in vision.

But *should* this scripture be taken literally?  I'd argue against it.
 First of  
all, the questions surrounding the context bother me.  If there *is* a
doctrinal  
point to be made, there are better places to make it than from the
mouth of a  
person who is about to die and be thus unable to further explain the
importance  
of what he has seen, and there are better people to relate it than an
anonymous  
historian who enjoys creating sermons and speeches for his characters
to say  
some thirty to forty *years* after the fact.  So off the bat, I already
have  
serious doubts about the importance that the author meant to place
behind this  
statement.

Secondly, the less-literal interpretation is *just* as valid.  Stephen
has  
finished a long exploration of Jewish history, covering how God has
given his  
people laws and prophets to guide them and how the people often reject
them.  He  
then accuses the people of having broken the Torah by killing God's
latest  
messenger of Jesus, and finishes by proclaiming that Jesus *is* a
messenger of  
God because he sees him in vision with God.  The vision as described
could mean  
that Jesus is standing on the right-hand side of God literally, or it
could be  
that Jesus is *set* (also a valid interpretation of the verb) in a
position of  
authority in relation to God.  Jesus is God's "right-hand man," in
other words.

> "To sit at the 'right hand' of the king was an honor (see 1 Kgs 2:19).
> In  
>  Ugaritic myth^[1][]^ the artisan god Kothar-and Khasis is described
> as sitting at  
>  the right hand of the storm god Baal. See G. R. Driver, *Canaanite
> Myths and  
>  Legends*, 61-62."  
>  <span>([Net Bible][], Psalm 110:1,  
>  Footnote 4)</span>

So it could be less a statement of their separateness and more a
statement that  
Jesus is indeed who Stephen said he was: a divine messenger approved of
and sent  
by God.  And, in the context of Stephen's sermon on Jewish history
leading up to  
the wrongful death of Jesus, it seems that this is the emotional climx
where  
Stephen gets to say that Jesus's position in God's plan is supreme.  In
context,  
it seems to be a very odd place to put any sort of statement on the
nature of  
God, and appears to be merely a statement on the authority of Jesus.
 Saying  
that God is embodied would have bothered 1st Century Jews far less than
saying  
that the radical preacher that had been executed a few years before was
God's  
messenger and that they are thus murderers and sinners against God.
 Which  
implication would have led to Stephen's death?  That the executed Jesus
was now  
in a position of authority.

Why Do I Think This Is Part of Scripture Mastery?
-------------------------------------------------

To me, it seems we've already covered the authority and position of
Jesus enough  
in previous scriptures as given ("Jesus Christ, whom [God] has sent").
Thus, I  
see little reason to pluck this relatively innocuous verse from its
obscurity in  
Acts and elevate it to the status of one of only 25 scriptures to
memorize from  
the New Testament.  There are so many other things that could have been
pulled  
from Acts, but this one made the cut.  I think the biggest reason is
again  
because it is viewed as an anti-Trinitarian scripture (which it is not;
it is at  
most an anti-Modalist scripture).  It adds very little else to an
understanding  
of Jesus in LDS theology apart from this stance.  Again, I would not
be  
surprised to see this scripture dropped from any future reformulation
of the  
Scripture Mastery list.  It is used to argue against an incorrect
conception of  
what the debate over Mormon-Christian theology is about.
