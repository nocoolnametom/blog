Joss Whedon is Amazing
----------------------

As with many great posts on the bloggernacle, even out here in Outer
Blogness,  
let me start with an allusion to a work by the great hero of geek
culture, Mr.  
Joss Whedon, in particular his series *Angel*. The main character of
the show is  
Angel, a good vampire with a soul introduced in Whedon's first hit
series *Buffy  
the Vampire Slayer* (there are some major spoilers for both series
ahead, you  
have been warned). He and his friends attempt to combat the forces of
evil in  
Los Angeles mostly through the form of a small company of private
investigators  
for hire; by the point in the fifth and last season, Angel and his crew
of  
fellow do-gooders have been joined by the sarcastic Spike, a vampire
from  
*Buffy* that also regained his soul and, with it, the capacity for
choosing good  
(they are also in possession of a large law firm, too).<!--more-->

Spike and Angel, Vampires with Soul(s)  
[/caption]

In the "Buffyverse" vampires are demons who inhabit the bodies of
humans.  When  
a vampire is created, the demon destroys the soul of the human and the
resulting  
creature is a monster of pure evil.  Vampires don't just kill: they
revel in it.  
They enjoy evil.  And vampires are stronger, faster, and all-around
better than  
most humans, so they're dang good at rape, murder, and destruction.
 Angel was,  
for decades after his being sired, one of the deadliest vampires of
Europe until  
a gypsy curse "ensouled" him as punishment for his murders.  With a
soul, Angel  
now had the capacity for goodness and the years of death and torture he
had  
caused haunted him for yet further decades.  Spike was a vampire
created by one  
of Angel's sires, and the two had actually been compatriots in chaos
for a while  
in the late 19th Century.  In the course of *Buffy the Vampire Slayer*
Spike  
obtained a soul for himself, and while not nearly as haunted as Angel
was, Spike  
also feels a deep responsibility for his actions in the past.

It's the Odd Couple!  
[/caption]

In the season 5 episode "Damage", some of the events of the
now-cancelled  
*Buffy* have dangerous ramifications in *Angel* (and it's definitely
one of the  
most twisted episodes of what is already a darker series than *Buffy*).
 A girl  
named Dana has been a resident of a psychiatric ward for years after
she was  
abused by a serial killer that killed her family in front of her when
she was a  
little girl before she was finally found by authorities.  Because of
actions  
that took place at the series finale of *Buffy the Vampire Slayer*,
Dana has  
become imbued with the powers of a Slayer.  In other words, think
superpowers:  
Slayers are a special type of humans mystically empowered to be able to
fight  
vampires.  She's supernaturally strong, supernaturally aware of her  
surroundings, and her untrained fighting ability is already past what
most  
trained humans can accomplish.  Dana breaks out of the hospital she's
in, very  
violently, and begins a deadly swath of death and bloody violence as
she wanders  
Los Angeles looking for the man who killed her family.

Angel and Spike are made aware of her and begin an attempt to find her.
 Due to  
the fact that her being imbued with the power of Slayers also means
that she has  
something of a connection to the Slayers of the past, Dana has memories
of  
Spike, who has killed two Slayers in his pre-souled days, mixed in
among her  
memories of being held captive by the serial killer.  Confused and
thinking that  
Spike was her family's murderer, Dana captures him and tortures him
horribly  
(I'm not kidding; she even cuts off his hands at one point).

Poor Spike is unable to play Paper, Rock, Scissors.  
[/caption]

Angel eventually shows up and rescues them.  The episode ends with both
Angel  
and a physically-recovering Spike (hands magically re-attached), who
have a very  
"odd couple" friendship, sitting in Angel's office reflecting on how
even though  
Spike wasn't actually the man who broke Dana's mind and robbed her of
her  
childhood, the old Spike and the old Angel were the sort of monsters
who could  
have and would have done such a thing.

Victims, once upon a time.  
[/caption]

It's an odd and troubling reminder that while these two heroes used to
be  
villains, even before the villainy they both used to be rather normal
human men.  
And in fact, all of the evil vampires seen in the Buffyverse were once
regular  
human beings before they became evil demons lusting for carnage and
blood.  
Behind every evil vampire is a victim.

What the heck does this have to do with Post-Mormons?
-----------------------------------------------------

Let's step into the TBM mindset a bit.

I am an Exmormon (though personally I think I might be better described
by the  
term Former Mormon or Post-Mormon).  In the Doctrine and Covenants,
the  
following description is given of male priesthood holders in the Church
who  
abuse their authority, but it's often applied toward people like me:

> ... When we undertake to cover our sins, or to gratify our pride, our
> vain  
>  ambition, or to exercise control or dominion or compulsion upon the
> souls of  
>  the children of men, in any degree of unrighteousness, behold, the
> heavens  
>  withdraw themselves; the Spirit of the Lord is grieved; and when it
> is  
>  withdrawn, Amen to the priesthood or the authority of that man.
> Behold, ere he  
>  is aware, he is left unto himself, to kick against the pricks, to
> persecute  
>  the saints, and to fight against God. <span>(D&C 121:37-38)</span>

Some members of the Church ask themselves why people like me exist?  I
still  
care about the Church, but I do not believe in it.  I poke and pull at
the  
history because it is fascinating and with every new fact I learn, I
cement ever  
further in my mind that this enterprise simply does not measure up to
what it  
claims to be.  Why?  The reason, according to some, is that I have lost
the  
Spirit of the Lord, and I have been left to myself and have begun to
kick  
against the pricks and persecute the saints and to fight against God.

Also, because many of us found ourselves no longer believing in the
truth claims  
of the LDS Church because of our research, some of us may have heard
the words  
of Jacob in the Book of Mormon:

> O that cunning plan of the evil one! O the vainness, and the
> frailties, and  
>  the foolishness of men! When they are learned they think they are
> wise, and  
>  they hearken not unto the counsel of God, for they set it aside,
> supposing  
>  they know of themselves, wherefore, their wisdom is foolishness and
> it  
>  profiteth them not. And they shall perish. <span>(2 Nephi
> 9:28)</span>

So again, the implication here is that my learning has caused me to set
aside  
the counsel of God.

Take a Trip in My Shoes in Your World
-------------------------------------

That may be all well and good (I don't think it actually is), but have
any of  
the believers ever thought to step into my shoes from their own
worldview and  
see what the view looks like in here?

Have I actually lost the Spirit of the Lord?  Maybe I have.  I do not
know for  
certain, but it could be.  I still feel those feelings that I used to
believe  
was the Spirit speaking revelation to my soul, but those feelings come
randomly  
and not always at what most believing Mormons would view as the most
opportune  
times.  At times I can actually cause the same feelings to occur
purposefully if  
I'm already calm.  So I'm not sure if I've lost the Spirit or not, but
let's  
assume for the sake of argument that I have.  I have been left by God
to kick  
against the pricks and I am now persecuting the saints and fighting
against God.  
You know what, I'll accept that, for now for the sake of the argument.

And did this occur because I was "learned"?  Probably.  I'll freely
admit that I  
lost my testimony because it could not stand up to the information I
learned as  
I studied Church history from sources that were either believing
members or  
neutral sources that had nothing to do with Mormonism.  My testimony
was not  
demolished by anti-Mormons.  It was demolished by discovering Joseph's
duplicity  
about his polygamy from both the public and his own wife in *Mormon
Enigma*.  It  
was demolished by learning about polyandry from *Rough Stone Rolling*.
It was  
demolished by learning from *Guns, Germs, and Steel* about how
beneficial  
western animals and agricultural technology were to Eurasian peoples to
such an  
extent that if those animals and technologies ever existed in the
Americas they  
would provide such a boon to their societies that we'd never expect to
see them  
all disappear centuries before the arrival of Columbus.  Sure, barley
was  
domesticated in the American Southwest long after the timeline of the
Book of  
Mormon, but the Nephites entire economic system was founded around
barley, and  
there's no barley to be found in the time period of the Book of Mormon
peoples,  
let alone in any of the proposed places where the Book of Mormon is
supposed to  
have occurred.  Stuff like that.

So did I lose my testimony because of my own foolishness in "setting
aside the  
counsels of God"?  I guess so, sure, again for the sake of argument
I'll accept  
that for now.  I let my belief in the importance of rationality and
historical  
study blind me to the explanation that somehow everything still fit
together in  
spite of the apparent evidence against it.

Deception
---------

So here I stand, then.  I am an Exmormon, unknowingly abandoned by God's
Spirit  
and left to the influence of the devil.  Interestingly, there is one
more aspect  
of Mormon scriptures that often comes up about Exmormons.  The
Anti-Christ  
Korihor "explains" in the Book of Mormon:

> But behold, the devil hath deceived me; for he appeared unto me in the
> form of  
>  an angel, and said unto me: Go and reclaim this people, for they have
> all gone  
>  astray after an unknown God. And he said unto me: There is no God;
> yea, and he  
>  taught me that which I should say. And I have taught his words; and I
> taught  
>  them because they were pleasing unto the carnal mind; and I taught
> them, even  
>  until I had much success, insomuch that I verily believed that they
> were true;  
>  and for this cause I withstood the truth. <span>(Alma 30:53)</span>

Now, setting aside the always hilarious questions of how a person might
believe  
it if a divine being told them there was no such thing as a divinity,
Korihor  
accepts that he was "deceived".  Another opponent of the Book of
Mormon  
prophets, Sherem, also told the people he was "deceived":

> And he spake plainly unto them, that he had been deceived by the power
> of the  
>  devil. And he spake of hell, and of eternity, and of eternal
> punishment.  
>  <span>(Jacob 7:18)</span>

What are we to make of this then?  Apparently, it's not just that I've
lost the  
Spirit.  It's not just that I was too devoted to learning.  I've also
been  
*deceived* by the devil.  Satan has tricked me.

Here's the thing, though: if we accept that I've been deceived by the
devil into  
the loss of my testimony, *I don't remember when that actually
occurred*.  I do  
not remember there ever being a time where I thought to myself, "Self,
I think  
I'm being tricked here, and I will consciously go along with this
deception  
against my mind and my viewpoint."

Satan has apparently been so subtle in how he gained control of me that
I never  
even knew it occurred.  I still don't.  I don't feel any different as a
person.  
I mean, I feel smarter, happier, and as though I'm a better human
being.  But I  
don't feel somehow more evil, or more devoted to sins.  I actually feel
less.  
Well played, Satan!  How very devious!  In my many compounding sins as
an  
Exmormon I actually feel more morally upright than I felt as a
believing member!  
How blind I am!  And I'm completely unaware of it.

How is an Exmormon like a Buffyverse Vampire?
---------------------------------------------

This brings me back to the part at the beginning of the post, with Angel
and  
Spike.  As a TBM, we can easily view the loss of a testimony and the
transition  
of a person from a believing member of the Church to a self-identified
post-  
Mormon along the same lines as Whedon's vampires.  It can, and does,
happen to  
anyone.

There is no calling that will prevent someone from losing their faith
within it.  
There is no location you can live that will better shore up the
defenses of your  
testimony.  Men and women, both old and young, can find themselves
leaving their  
faith.  Bishops, Stake Presidents, Mission Presidents, Temple Sealers,
Stake  
Relief Society presidents, ward librarians, 2nd Quorum of the Seventy,
Quorum of  
the Twelve, Provo, Los Angeles, Santiago, it doesn't matter.  Converts
and  
multi-generational members born in the covenant can leave.  As with
Whedon's  
vampires, *it can happen to anyone*.  And once it does, it changes
people in a  
way that they'll never be able to return to that faith again.  Even if
they do  
recover enough of their beliefs to attend again, their beliefs are now
tempered  
by a flexibility that most average members would find heretical.
 Belief in a  
19th Century Book of Mormon.  Belief that Brigham Young was never
really a  
prophet.  Belief that Priesthood might merely be a tool God uses to
help some of  
his simpler followers feel superior.  Belief in their own personal
revelation  
from God instead of institutional "revelation" from the Church
figureheads.  
Basically, though, they can't go back, at least not all the way.  We're
changed,  
forever.

And if this happened because of the Devil deceiving us, then are we not
victims  
in this narrative?  Whedon often uses his vampires to illustrate issues
with  
violence and victimhood.  In the old story of the hypothetical woman
walking  
down the alley at night alone who gets attacked, Whedon firmly comes
down  
against saying that the woman has any responsibility for that attack.
 The  
responsibility lies at the feet of fate and circumstance and the
attacker.  What  
woman could stand up against a vampire, for example?  What blame could
she  
possibly hold?  And in the Buffyverse, there's no such thing as simply
being in  
the "wrong place".  Vampires can attack anyone at anytime.  Even the
LDS Church  
has come to officially realize that in the case of actual violent
crimes like  
this, a victim bears no sin or responsibility.  Culturally?  Well,
there's still  
a long way to go there, but at least in their materials they're better
now than  
they used to be.

Victims
-------

And theologically speaking from Mormon scripture and practice, in the
case of  
other "victims" of fate and circumstance, God also comes down on the
side of not  
punishing.  We are told that little children cannot sin, so they are
saved  
through the atonement of Christ if they, through fate and circumstance,
die.  
Are they baptized?  No, they are not.  It doesn't matter.  What about
those who,  
through fate and circumstance, never hear the gospel?  God apparently
has made  
allowances, as well, for those "who are only kept from the truth
because they  
know not where to find it" (D&C 123:12).

So what about those of us who are also the victims of fate and
circumstance?  I  
never made a conscious decision to leave my faith.  I never made a
conscious  
choice to rebel.  I do not remember ever having the option of going one
way or  
the other, and even if I did, I never knew the ramifications of what
that choice  
would be.  Perhaps the Spirit nudged me away from picking up *Mormon
Enigma*,  
*Rough Stone Rolling*, or *Guns, Germs, and Steel*, but if it did I was
not  
aware of the eternal ramifications that lay behind that very gentle
nudging.  
The still, small voice was, in this case, a little bit too *still* and
too  
*small* because it didn't do a very good job of keeping me safe.  I
read, I  
pondered, my perspective shifted, and *before I was even aware of it*
my beliefs  
had already changed.

This seems to even be part of the first scripture quote way up above:
"ere he is  
aware".  All of this happened even before I was aware of it.  I still
am not  
aware of it.  I am being brutally honest here: I am not aware of how
this change  
in myself occurred.  I cannot pinpoint the time and place where I chose
for any  
of this to happen.  There was no light switch for me to flip from
belief to non-  
belief.  It was flipped for me before I even knew what was going on.

And I'm still ignorant of it.  I know it's common for believing members
to  
assume that I still know "deep down".  I don't.  At least not
consciously, and  
if there is not deep part of my heart that is still converted and my
mind is  
unaware of it, well then what's the point of that?  What good does that
little  
part do me if it's so powerless that I am completely unaware of its
existence?  
I can't flip that switch back to belief because I don't even know where
it was  
when it got flipped to non-belief in the first place.

I don't believe in the LDS Church anymore.  I do not believe in the
existence of  
Satan; there is real evil enough in our human world among us human
beings that  
we don't need him to explain the bad stuff in the world.  I believe in
human  
agency, at least in the sense that if humans don't actually have free
will then  
our brains are working in such a way that we believe we do.  So I don't
believe  
in a tempter when I believe that humans can choose to be good or evil.
 I don't  
even believe in the divinity of Jesus, though I think the case for the  
historical existence of an itinerant Jewish prophet named "Yeshua" in
First  
Century Palestine who was executed (probably for sedition) is strong
enough even  
without unbiased sources mentioning him.

But this post is about hypotheticals, specifically the hypothetical that
I am  
wrong.  And I will always allow that I might be wrong.  There is always
going to  
be a chance greater than 0% that the LDS Church's truth claims are
actually  
valid and that I am wrong for rejecting them.

In this world we are exploring together where I *am* wrong and the LDS
Church  
*is* right, we've already established that I have been deceived into my
current  
actions even before I was aware of it.  I am a victim.  And we've
established  
that God tends to make allowances for other victims.

Empathy
-------

In Alma 7:11-12, Alma tells the people of Gideon about the coming
Christ.

> And he shall go forth, suffering pains and afflictions and temptations
> of  
>  every kind; and this that the word might be fulfilled which saith he
> will take  
>  upon him the pains and the sicknesses of his people. And he will take
> upon him  
>  death, that he may loose the bands of death which bind his people;
> and he will  
>  take upon him their infirmities, that his bowels may be filled with
> mercy,  
>  according to the flesh, that he may know according to the flesh how
> to succor  
>  his people according to their infirmities.

Most Mormons point to this verse to state how one of the purposes of
Jesus's  
Atonement, his suffering, death, and resurrection, was so that he
would  
intimately understand us and our lives.  Apparently, Jesus knows what
it's like  
to suffer every pain, hurt, heartache, and sin.  This means that he
knows what  
it's like to be me: someone who was blindsided by information before I
was aware  
of it.  I had as much of a conscious choice in losing my testimony as
someone  
does of walking in front of a truck while texting.  Were "bad"
decisions made  
that led to this situation?  Sure, but the effects are unexpectedly
vaster in  
scope than I ever realized.  But apparently, just as Jesus knows what
it's like  
to be suddenly and unexpectedly smashed out of this life while
innocently, and  
perhaps stupidly, texting, so too should he know what it's like to live
my life.  
To love faith even before I was aware of it.  To be so perfectly
deceived by  
Satan that I don't even feel deceived.  And I think it's very difficult
for  
someone to understand the troubles and difficulties of someone else and
not  
empathize with them a little.

Humility
--------

So as I close this hypothetical and step back into my normal worldview
where I  
don't believe in a devil and often not even a God, let me just say
this: I think  
that Mormon theology has implications that victims are covered.  So I'm
not  
really too worried about being wrong.  Unless I'm *really* wrong about
all of  
this and am looking forward to an eternity of misery.  But it's not
like my life  
will be any worse or better if I send time being worried about that, so
I'm just  
going to move on in my life and assume that God's love for me is
because he  
understands me and he knows how honest I am when I will tell him that I
lost  
faith in his Church, and even him, because he just made it so damn hard
to  
believe in the face of so much contrary evidence with only a little
happy fuzzy  
feeling occasionally to reassure me that it was all okay (a feeling
that  
continues even today, sometimes at the oddest times which perhaps
indicates that  
my antenna for receiving such spiritual messages might be a little
broken).

And for those believing members who've gotten all the way to the end
here, let  
me just say this.  I understand you.  I understand your perspective and
I  
understand why I worry you, bother you, and sometimes confuse you.  I
understand  
why some of you think I've been continuously lying throughout this
piece, and  
why others think I'm subconsciously lying to myself.  Because I've been
there.  
And yes, I've become a big scary vampire (well, maybe not that scary to
you) and  
it was, to me at least, unexpected.  And for some of you reading, it
will be  
just as unexpected for you, too.

I'm not expecting you to stop fighting just as I don't expect to stop my
own  
actions within this sphere for a while as long as so many of my family
and  
friends are still part of LDS social circles and as long as LDS
terminology and  
worldviews continue to permeate our conversations.  But in the midst of
the war  
of words between the critic and the apologist, I'm asking for you to
have some  
compassion for us, some understanding.

Because no matter how evil I may seem to you, how scary, how dangerous
to you or  
those you love I may appear, I was a victim, too, once upon a time.
