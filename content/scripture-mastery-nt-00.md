What do I mean by "looking at scripture mastery"? Let me explain the
background  
for this project.

I've spent the past five or so years trying hard to learn as much as
possible  
about the Hebrew Bible and Christian New Testament in an attempt to
save my  
struggling testimony of the LDS Church.  I listened to countless hours
of  
lectures and presentations by some of the biggest names in the field,
read  
thousands of pages in both books and journals, gained a functional
understanding  
and ability in reading Ancient Greek (the language the Christian New
Testament  
was written in), wrote personal papers on a number of topics relating
to  
translation and exegesis, and am currently in the middle of an attempt
to write  
a book about the contextual history of the Council of Nicea in 325 CE
for a  
Mormon audience (or an audience at least informed by a common LDS
narrative  
about the Council and its resulting Creed).  And in the end, very
little of what  
I learned helped me as I struggled to make sense of Joseph Smith's
approach to  
and use of these ancient sources as he led his modern restorationist
movement.  
<!--more--> However, I found that it ignited a passion inside of me
about these  
ancient sources that has endured my loss of faith in my childhood
religion.  No  
longer a believer in Mormonism, or even the basic Christian gospel to
be honest,  
I have been surprised to find that I love the New Testament even more
as an  
agnostic theist than I ever did before as a devoted member of the
Church of  
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Part of that is because of how my
approach to  
the Christian Bible has changed.

Growing up in the LDS Church I've always been a voracious reader and
thinker and  
I enjoyed Seminary and Institute because I could apply learning towards
the  
scriptures.  It also helped that so much of Seminary was based around  
memorization.  I still remember, to this day, tons of references to
various  
parts of the Bible and other LDS scriptures, and I have good Seminary
teachers  
to thank for it.  I still remember how those scriptures were taught to
me, and  
why they were supposed to be important.  However, going back to many of
them now  
has been an enlightening, if somewhat disappointing, experience as I've
found  
that there were obviously many hidden reasons I was being taught these  
scriptures and how to read them.  I was being primed against common
objections  
to the LDS Church without being given a full understanding of what
those  
objections would be beforehand, and, in the worst cases, being given
complete  
straw men arguments for why the particular scriptures in question were  
important.

Seminary is a four-year program meant to coincide with the American High
School  
experience.  During each of these four years a list of 25 scriptures
are  
expected to be memorized (resulting in 100 scriptures for the full
fours years).  
This list is known as **Scripture Mastery**.  While the purpose of
Seminary is  
overall to improve the students' testimonies of the restored Gospel and
of Jesus  
Christ, the presence of these 100 scriptures can be seen as a baseline  
expectation for students.  In other words, even if the students are
goofing off,  
even if they barely pay attention, even if they are so hopped up on
hormones and  
dating that they don't really learn much about Mormonism, if they can
leave the  
Seminary building with the general gist of most of these 100 scriptures
inside  
their head then the teachers have succeeded.  Not everyone will read
the  
entirety of the LDS Standard Works, and not everyone will be touched
with a  
spiritual experience that will strengthen their faith in the LDS
Church, but  
everyone can memorize these scriptures.

So, with that in mind, I thought it would be interesting to look at each
of  
these scriptures in turn.  Some of them make complete sense and
certainly  
contribute strongly to the central themes and doctrines of Mormonism.
 However,  
others are prime examples of a deliberate ignorance of context.  And
finally,  
many, if not most, of these scriptures are ammunition in an expected
future  
debate that the students may find themselves in against conservative
Christian  
antagonists against often caricatured LDS beliefs (and sometimes the
anticipated  
arguments are themselves caricatures).  These "Bible bashing"
scriptures may  
assist potential missionaries in discussions with other Christians, but
in an  
increasingly secular America these arguments are occurring with less
frequency  
as Christian influence is slowly waning and as Christians themselves
are  
becoming more educated on actual Mormon doctrine and the real issues
for LDS  
theology and history instead of the horrible caricatures of the late
20th  
Century counter-cult ministries.  Not to mention how these scriptures
aren't  
nearly as helpful in other less-Christian areas of the world, such as
the Far  
East or in the face of rising Islamic influence in places like Europe.
These are  
the issues I'd like to look at for these scriptures, and the best part
is that  
with 100 scriptures there's a *lot* to talk about.  There's certainly
not enough  
to spend a full post on *every* scripture, of course, and some of them
are  
extremely benign and are good scriptures and ideals for *everyone* to
follow  
whether Christian, humanist, or Mormon.  But the secret for readership
is  
consistency, right?

So this project gives me a *lot* of opportunities for me to keep posting
and get  
some good discussion going. Over the next few weeks I'll be covering
the 25  
scriptures that Seminary students are expected to memorize during their
time  
studying the Christian New Testament.  This is because I can speak
personally to  
issues of translation (which I cannot do for the Hebrew Bible as I know
neither  
Hebrew nor Aramaic), and have spent most of my attention on the world
of  
Classical antiquity. For those who want to get ready, here is the list
of  
scriptures:

-   Matthew 5:14-16
-   Matthew 6:24
-   Matthew 16:15-19
-   Matthew 25:40
-   Luke 24:36-39
-   John 3:5
-   John 7:17
-   John 10:16
-   John 14:15
-   John 17:3
-   Acts 7:55-56
-   Romans 1:16
-   1 Corinthians 10:13
-   1 Corinthians 15:20-22
-   1 Corinthians 15:29
-   1 Corinthians 15:40-42
-   Ephesians 4:11-14
-   2 Thessalonians 2:1-3
-   2 Timothy 3:1-5
-   2 Timothy 3:16-17
-   Hebrews 5:4
-   James 1:5-6
-   James 2:17-18
-   Revelation 14:6-7
-   Revelation 20:12-13

For each scripture I'm going to assume a certain level of understanding
of the  
Christian New Testament, but as issues of authorship and perspective
are issues  
I find interesting, I'm sure that much time will be spent with each
discussing  
some of the historical context and viewpoint of the authors.  Too often
Mormons,  
and Exmormons as well, approach the Bible as a modern work of history
where the  
authors have few biases and are interested in an accurate portrayal of
history.  
Nothing could be further from the truth, so these issues of
understanding the  
author as well as the text are important, so I hope that everyone will
have  
learned something by the time we're done.  And I hope *I* learn a lot,
too.  I'd  
encourage everyone to respond and comment upon each page; point out
where I'm  
wrong and help me out in this project. I think we'll have a lot of fun
and I  
look forward to getting started soon.
