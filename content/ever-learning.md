Luke 2:14 - Goodwill(ed) Men
=======================================

>  Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.

This isn't so much a *mistranslation* as it is an example of the
complicated nature of the history of the New Testament.  This phrase is spoken by
the hosts of heaven appearing to the shepherds outside of Bethlehem during Luke's
version of the birth narrative.  The issue is over the word "good
will": εὐδοκία *eudokía.  *First, *eudokía* might be better translated as "good
favor", it's not a quality that someone can have or gain on their own, but one that
they obtain from others.  So in this case, the favor is coming from God.

The second, and larger issue, is one of grammar.  In English, grammar is
usually expressed through word order: subject, verb, direct object. In Greek,
grammar is usually expressed through changes to the word's pronunciation and
spelling.  The problem is that the word *eudokía* appears as εὐδοκίας *eudokías* in a
good deal of the oldest manuscripts - note the little sigma at the end.  That
little sigma changes it from the nominative case (or roughly the subject of the
verb) to the genitive case (or roughly the ownership case represented in English by
the word "of", the book *of John).  *That little sigma at the end changes the
phrase to read:

>  Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace toward humans of
>  good-favor.

Now there's evidence for both readings in some of our oldest
manuscripts, but it's easier for scholars to assume that the work was originally written
with a sigma that occasionally got forgotten than to imagine that someone
decided that they'd purposefully place a sigma at the end of the world.  Thus, the
majority of scholars (but by no means all of them) feel that the actual reading
of this famous verse should read something akin to:

>  Glory to God in the highest, and peace on earth toward humans of his good
>  favor.

Philippians 2:6 - Robbery
=========================

>  Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with
>  God.

This verse needs a bit of context. Paul is talking about how Christians
should follow the example of Christ. Then this verse follows. Take a quick
look at Philippians 2 to see the entirely of what seems to be Paul quoting an
early Christian hymn or poem.

The problem with this verse is the word "robbery". In English this verse
makes it sound like Jesus felt that it would not be something wrong or
undeserved to be equal with God. Some Mormons (though not many, admittedly) feel that
this verse is talking about the doctrine of eternal progression whereby even
Christ had to progress to become like God.

In actuality, the word underlying "robbery", ἁρπαγμός *harpagmós*, has
an interesting history in Greek. Over its history it morphed from being
used as the act of theft to being about the object of theft itself. In this way
it's remarkably similar to the English word "plunder", which can refer to
either the act of plundering or to that which is plundered. (Note: there's no
actual relationship between plunder and *harpagmós*, they just end up working
similarly and means similar things).

This is why this verse would be better translated as:

>  Who, being in the form of God, thought equality with God as something not to
>  be taken.

This changes the meaning substantially; now the entire hymn is about how
Jesus, though he is in the form of God, *rejects* equality with God and
instead humbled himself. The rest of the verses talk about this humility, encouraging
the Philippians to also be humble in their circumstances before God.

1 Thessalonians 5:22 - All Appearance
=====================================

>  Abstain from all appearance of evil.

This one is actually pretty simple. Whereas many Mormon parents use it
to say that actions that they think l*ook* evil should be avoided, even if
they aren't *actually* evil. But the word εἶδος *eídos* ("shape, form, appearance")
is referring to evil in the sense that anytime evil *appears* then it
should be avoided. Quite simply, Paul is telling his followers that they should
leave all *kinds\*\* \*of evil alone. He's not saying that the Thessalonians
should care about whether or not their actions \*seem* evil to others.

1 Timothy 4:8 - Bodily Exercise
===============================

>  For bodily exercise profiteth little: but godliness is profitable unto all
>  things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.

Again, this one doesn't come up often, but I *have* heard some people
use it to justify Mormons' general sweet teeth (sweet tooths?): "bodily exercise
profiteth little". It sounds like Pseudo-Paul (because remember, Paul didn't
write either letters to Timothy) is dumping on the concept of exercise. However, the
English phrase should be read literally: he's comparing exercise to being
godly. Physical exercise is good for a few things, but godliness is good for
all things because of what Pseudo-Paul thinks godliness can accomplish as opposed
to what physical exercise can accomplish.

1 Timothy 4:12 - In Conversation
================================

>  Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in
>  word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.

This scripture is sometimes given to LDS youth, and in general I don't
think it's a bad choice, but the word "conversation" here doesn't mean their
manner of speaking. That's covered by Pseudo-Paul's encouragement to be an
example "in word". Instead, conversation means their actions.

2 Timothy 3:7 - Ever Learning
=============================

>  Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.

Mormons often apply this scripture against intellectual critics of the
Church, including former members who lost their faith because they were too
focused on studying the history of the organization and are now blinded from faith
due to their learning. And why not, right? This chapter begins with a
description of the many types of horrible people that will be around during the "last
days", so obviously this verse is talking about those people.

It's not. Let's give a little more context for it from the preceding
verse, which follows a long list of horrible way people will behave in the
last days.

>  <span>6</span> For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead
>  captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,
>  <span>7</span> Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the
>  truth.

The people who are ever learning are the people Pseudo-Paul describes as
"silly women laden with sins, led away with diverse lusts". (We should note
that Pseudo-Paul really is a rather blatant misogynist; there are other
places in the New Testament that aren't good towards women, but Pseudo-Paul is the
author of the strongest anti-women passages.) The evil people described in the
scripture mastery verses *lead* people into ever learning, but they themselves
are not described as being in this position. Pseudo-Paul never indicates if
these "silly women" are Jesus followers or not. I think that to only apply this
phrase of "ever learning" to intelligent people outside of the LDS Church is just
a way to salve worries that their intelligence might be an indication of real
problems.
