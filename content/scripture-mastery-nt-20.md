Again, this scripture mastery verse is simple, and thus to me is boring.
 Not  
looking forward to this one.

Pseudo-Paul has just finished explaining the many dangerous kind of
people who  
would arise at the last days and warns Timothy against them (somewhat
implying  
that Timothy lives in the last days).  In the previous post we read the
warning.

Here Pseudo-Paul is explaining how Timothy can be prepared: he can fall
back to  
what he already knows.  According to Pseudo-Paul, Timothy is
third-generation  
Christian (another mark against actual Pauline authorship, as three
generations  
of Gentiles within the movement would have been hard to achieve within
Paul's  
lifetime), and he has been raised knowing the scriptures.

That's the context, but there *are* two things I find interesting about
this  
verse.

First, this is a verse commonly used by individuals who feel that the
Christian  
Bible is without any errors. It doesn't same "some scripture", or
"those  
scriptures", but instead says "all scriptures" are inspired of God.  Of
course,  
at the time of Pseudo-Paul the writings of the New Testament were only
just  
beginning to be viewed as scripture themselves (and in the time of the  
historical Paul various Christians may have been writing letters and
gospels,  
but they weren't yet viewed as *scripture)*, so the author might only
have the  
Jewish scriptures in mind when he writes this.

Secondly, and interestingly, the Joseph Smith Translation actually
tackles this  
issue by shuffling a few words around to result in the following:

> <span>16</span> **And** all scripture ~~is~~ given by inspiration of  
>  God, ~~and~~ is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for
> correction,  
>  for instruction in righteousness;  
>  <span>17</span> That the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly
> furnished unto  
>  all good works.

Now the scripture is saying that all *inspired* scripture is useful.
 Big change  
from a few word changes.  Unfortunately, while this change is very easy
to make  
in English, it's extremely difficult to produce in the Greek and the
idea that  
Joseph Smith's rendering is the actual original is nearly impossible.
 But it's  
still an interesting look at how some Mormons respond to the use of
this  
scripture as a statement of biblical inerrancy.

In the official CES manuals on this chapter neither the inerrancy
interpretation  
nor the JST edits are discussed.  Instead, the focus appears to be on
the last  
phrase, that the man of God may be perfect, fully accomplished toward
all good  
labors.  It seems that someone in the CES department decided that this
was  
another verse about the importance of works in salvation.  But, again,
that's  
not what the scripture itself actually says.  It just says that the
result of  
using scripture as a tool of various uses is that people are perfected
and  
filled with good works.  Nothing about salvation here.

Why Do I Think This Is Part of Scripture Mastery?
-------------------------------------------------

I think this verse was chosen because it speaks of how works arise from
the use  
of scriptures, with the unspoken assumption that this is the purpose of
the  
scriptures: to help humans have good works.  In the end, though, I
think it's a  
very odd and boring choice of a scripture.
