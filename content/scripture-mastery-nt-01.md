Before we begin, let me make a quick note on my translations: I am
making these translations partially to be read in conjunction with the more-familiar
King James translation.  Don't read my translation as being somehow "more
accurate" intrinsically, but rather I'm trying to give a sense for the range of
meaning that can be expressed by the verse by presenting the two translations
together. I'll let you know when the KJV is probably in error and will point out
the better reading.  If I don't say anything, please assume that while I am
giving an accurate translation it's just meant to be read to give some color
and breadth to the KJV reading.  The King James Version is problematic not
because of its errors (though there are errors) but rather because of the age
of the English text that makes it ever more obscure as it ages.  As a
translation, the KJV is remarkably apt at preserving some of the oddities of the
underlying Greek grammar (and this is partially why it can be difficult to read at
times).

So, first out of the gate is Matthew 5:14-16.  This is from what is
arguable the most famous sermon in the entire Christian New Testament: Matthew's
Sermon on the Mount.  A long collection of statements on the Jewish Torah, this
sermon presents Jesus as a great Rabbi who is upholding the validity of the
Torah even as he presents a viewpoint on it that supersedes and extends it (one
reason why some scholars speculate that the historical Jesus might have actually
been a Pharisee; I don't agree, but it's an intriguing possibility).  The
section in question has been famous throughout much of Christianity for centuries
(there's even the fun children's song "This Little Light of Mine").  A quick
note on the KJV of the text: when it says "Let your light so shine" it's not a
nice suggestion that we should *allow* our lights to shine, but it's
a *command.* The verb is an imperative, Jesus is telling his followers that they
must *shine*.  It's not a passive acceptance, but a call to action.

There isn't really much to be said about this scripture that is
particular a Mormon point of view, except that as read by most Mormons of Seminary
age, the statement is taken as a call for Mormons to let *their* light shine
before the world.  But then again, that's pretty much an anecdotal viewpoint based
on my own upbringing and childhood experiences.  It could be (and probably
is) different in some areas of the Church.  However, as we'll see in later scriptures, the Seminary scripture mastery scriptures aren't always the
best example of ecumenicism anyways.

Why Do I Think This Is Part of Scripture Mastery?
-------------------------------------------------

To encourage Mormon youth to be evangelical in their faith through both
actions and words.  Also, it provides a sense of superiority through membership
in the Church by associating Christ's statement of "Ye are the light of the
world" to members of the LDS Church.
