Finally, three scriptures in and we hit a doozy!  The keys of the
kingdom, given  
to Peter, and the cryptic phrase, "You are Peter and upon this rock I
will build  
my Church".  A similar scripture is found in Mark, but in his editing
of Mark,  
Matthew has added this statement of Jesus in response to Peter's
declaration,  
that Jesus's church would be built on this rock (note that Peter's name
means  
"rock") and that Peter would be given the keys of the kingdom, all of
which is  
absent in the original material of Mark.

The reason this is a doozy is because this scripture is viewed by many  
Christians, predominantly Catholics but also many Protestants, as the
divine  
call for Peter to lead the church, while for Mormons it is viewed as a
statement  
that the Church of Christ is built upon the foundation
of *revelation*.  It's an  
important distinction, and we'll take a look at it.

First, though, a few translation points.  Again, remember that the
translation  
I'm providing, while still correct, is by design a little strained. 
It's meant  
to show which words in the more-familiar King James translation have a
wider  
meaning than the given English.  One example is the word *ecclesia*,
"church".  
It literally means a gathering, or a group "called out".  And in Greek
it would  
not have meant "church" as Mormons or Christians today use it.  There
are other  
examples of *ecclesia* in the Greek-speaking world, and it might make
more sense  
to translate the word as "club".  *Ecclesia* weren't always religious
in nature,  
but could be organized around cultural groups, philosophical groups,
or  
political groups.  Jesus saying, however, that his *ecclesia* would be
built  
upon "this rock" (we'll get to *that* issue in a moment) is slightly
out of  
character from the other gospels.  Of the four Gospel-writers, only
Matthew is  
particularly focused on this idea of Jesus's *ecclesia*.  The word is
used in  
Matthew's Sermon on the Mount and other places within his gospel, but
is  
entirely absent in the other gospels.  Matthew is also uniquely focused
on the  
rules of a Christian community, with a focus, as we've discussed
before, on the  
Jewish Torah.  Whereas in other gospels Jesus presents a view of Torah
as a code  
not always to be followed (or even followed at all), Matthew presents a
view of  
Jesus where Torah and its observation is still supremely important for
Jesus and  
his followers.  Matthew's Jesus is the one who says that not one jot
nor tittle  
of the law had been done away with.

Why does any of this matter?  Because these books and these scriptures
were not  
written in a vacuum.  The books and letters of the New Testament had
human  
authors, inspired though you may feel they were, and these authors did
not  
always see eye to eye.  By the time the Gospel of Matthew, as we have
it today,  
was being produced there were already a number of different Christian  
communities throughout the eastern Roman Empire.  We know this because
the  
oldest Christian writings are *not* any of the Gospels, but are rather
the  
letters of Paul, written to many of these various communities (and in
fact,  
Matthew isn't even the first gospel to be written; Matthew makes
extensive  
editorial use of the gospel of Mark in writing his gospel).  And Paul
presents a  
picture of Christian doctrine and practice quite different from what
the author  
of Matthew presents.

We'll talk more about Paul when we reach his letters, but a short
overview of  
his life is that he was born a Jew, was originally opposed to those who
believed  
Jesus to be the Jewish Messiah, and had some sort of experience that
changed his  
mind to also believe that Jesus has risen from the dead as the Messiah
(recorded  
as a vision by the author of Luke, though Paul himself says very little
about  
the experience).  Paul's theological attempts to understand the
significance and  
meaning of Jesus's death and apparent resurrection (Paul himself joined
the  
movement long after the death of Jesus, but he believed as most Jesus
followers  
did that Jesus literally died when he was executed and rose alive again
after  
three days) helped him to reach some rather radical theological
conclusions  
about the necessity of the Jewish Torah.  As he relates in his letter
to the  
Galatians, these ideas of his led him to occasionally clash with other
Jesus  
followers, most famously against Simon Peter while he was visiting
Jerusalem.  
Peter was observing Jewish purity practices about not eating meals
with  
Gentiles, and Paul rebuked him for it.  Many of Paul's letters provide
details  
showing that this issue of whether Jesus followers, both
Gentile *and* Jewish,  
should follow Torah was one of the major dividing issues among early  
Christians.  They also show that many Christians of Paul's day appealed
to the  
authority of various Christian leaders in support of their viewpoints. 
Some of  
Paul's opponents who apparently felt that followers of Jesus needed to
observe  
Torah called themselves apostles, though whether these included any of
the  
traditional apostles named in the Gospels is unknown.

So among these leaders, we know that the famous names of authority
included  
Paul, Peter, and James (in fact, the Acts of the Apostles, the sequel
to Luke,  
seems to give James narrative supremacy over Peter when the movement
has to make  
decisions about Paul and the Gentiles).  Given Peter's occasional
opposition to  
Paul, it might be that this verse in Matthew represents the author's
attempt to  
place Peter as a higher authority to Paul: not only was he among the
original  
disciples of Jesus, but Jesus gave him "the keys of the kingdom".  This
is only  
supposition, of course, and is not in any way a provable hypothesis.

This leads to the other issue at hand: the "rock" upon which the
*ecclesia* is  
built.  In the Greek, there is an undeniable relationship between the
name Peter  
["a stone"] and the rock ["a crag, a cliff, a rock"].  *Something* is
implied by  
Matthew's Jesus in this phrase, and the issue is what that something
might be.  
The traditional Catholic reading is that Jesus is making a pun, and
that both  
rocks are the same: in other words, Jesus will built his *ecclesia*
upon  
*Peter*.  The tradtional Protestant reading is either the same as the
Catholics,  
or that the foundation in question is Peter's faith in Jesus as the
Messiah (not  
faith in general, but Peter's specific declaration that Jesus is the
Christ).

The Mormon reading for this verse comes from some handwritten notes
taken during  
a sermon given by Joseph Smith in 1843.  In these notes, the author,
Wilford  
Woodruff, records that Joseph asked, "And what is that rock?" with the
answer,  
"The rock of revelation".  So for Joseph Smith the relationship between
the two  
rocks is that Peter, the one rock, had received revelation from the
Father in  
Heaven when he proclaimed that Jesus was the Messiah.  This is the
other rock,  
and the *ecclesia* was to be built upon this foundation of revelation,
at least  
if this one reference represents Joseph's full feelings on the matter.

One aspect of this interpretation that is useful for Mormons is how it
changes  
the interpretation of the next aspect of the verses: the reference to
the gates  
of Hell.  From a Mormon point of view, true Christian doctrine was lost
soon  
after the death of the Apostles leading to a period of nearly two
thousand years  
where God's authority and true teachings were not present on earth. 
This is  
called the Great Apostasy, and was ended in 1820 when Joseph Smith
received what  
became known as his first vision.  If Jesus's statement about how his
church was  
founded upon the rock is referring to Peter, then Mormons have a
problem,  
because they feel that the organization led by Peter, which eventually
became  
the Catholic Church and many other churches from it, *was* overcome. 
What then  
of the statement of Jesus that the Church would not be prevailed
against?  Well,  
if the rock is instead a concept of revelation, then it's much easier
to deal  
with the verse: God never took the ability for his children to be led
by  
revelation away.  So that rock has always remained.

Is there any foundation for the interpretation of the rock being
revelation in  
the original Greek?  Sorta, but if that was what was mean by Matthew's
Jesus  
then it *really* isn't very clear.  The statement uses two extremely
similar  
words, begins with the declarative statement, "You are Peter" (which
was not  
Peter's actual name; his name was Simon), and makes a connection based
on this  
image of a rock upon which a structure can be built.  Simon is a rock,
and the  
*ecclesia* is built on a rock.  If the relationship is more nuanced
than a  
direct correlation then the text itself does a poor job of showing that
nuanced  
relationship.  The *easiest* reading, which doesn't automatically mean
the most  
correct, would be that Matthew has Jesus saying that his *ecclesia*
would be  
built upon Peter.  But to imply that the Mormon reading is the only
valid  
interpretation without some flavor of a relationship between Peter's
authority  
(symbolized by receiving keys to the kingdom of heaven) and the
building of a  
church upon a rock is silly.

Finally, what are we to make of the reference to Peter's ability to tie
up  
tightly or loose on earth and in the heavens?  Remember that for those
with an  
apocalyptic worldview, the coming kingdom will violently overthrow the
world.  
That is because it is a literal kingdom that is approaching (contrast
this to  
the later Gospel of John, which tones down this "approaching" rhetoric
when  
Jesus says things like "the Kingdom of God is among you"), and it will
replace  
the evil powers currently controlling this world.  And in that coming
kingdom,  
those who have been oppressed will be lifted up.  Total reversals will
occur (go  
back and read the Beatitudes of Matthew 5 in this light and they make a
lot of  
sense).  Peter is being told that he is like a ruler in this world, and
that his  
decisions here will stand and be ratified in the coming kingdom.
 Whatever, or  
indeed *who*ever, he ties up or frees will remain tied up or freed.
 This is  
language that is likened to the most powerful aspect of a ruler: the
ability to  
lock up or the ability to pardon.  The Mormon perception of the
"sealing" power  
is similar to this viewpoint, however, in that Mormons view Peter being
given  
authority here to make decisions with heavenly ramifications, except
that for  
Mormons they feel that this power means that the decisions
have *immediate*  
authority and application in heaven and not merely that these decisions
will  
remain in force when a future heavenly kingdom arrives.

Why Do I Think This Is Part of Scripture Mastery?
-------------------------------------------------

In preparation for use of this scripture against their conception of a
universal  
apostasy, Mormon youth are prepped with this verse and an alternate  
interpretation that preserves their viewpoint.  This interpretation is
a valid  
reading, but it is *extremely* difficult to parse and is not the
easiest nor  
most likely reading.
