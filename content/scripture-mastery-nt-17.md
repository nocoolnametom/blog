A Translation Issue With This Scripture Mastery
-----------------------------------------------

A translation of this verse is problematic as it is a list of groups God
gave to  
keep the "church" unified.  Because of the construction of the lists,
these are  
meant to be read as discrete groups of people.  The final group, the
"shepherds  
and teachers" could be read as being the *same* group or a continuance
of the  
listing.  So we either have four groups named or we have five.  The
grammar,  
however, seems to indicate four groups.  The author uses the same
conjunction,  
δἐ *de*, which is much like saying "and on the other hand".  Think of
Tevye in  
"Fiddler on the Roof" where is his internal discussions with himself he
keeps  
jumping from one thought to another by saying, "but on the other hand".
 That's  
what the author is using to jump from one group to the next, except for
the last  
two groups named.  Unlike in English where we get weary from having too
many  
conjunctions (such as only saying "and" before the last item in a long
list),  
Greek has no problems with endlessly using the same conjunction.  So
the grammar  
seems to indicate that the last two groups are to be seen as a single
unit: the  
shepherds *and* teachers.  So the list seems to be a list of four
groups.  But  
it could simply be an artistic flourish to end a list differently than
how it  
was begun and perhaps the author meant to list five separate groups.
 The  
grammar thus leans more towards four groups, but it would not be
impossible for  
five different groups to be intended.

Anyways enough about the actual translation.  We're in a different
letter now,  
Ephesians.  What's going on here?

Did Paul Actually Write Ephesians?
----------------------------------

First off, we need to talk a bit about pseudepigrapha.  There are
generally  
three groups of letters that are claimed to be by Paul: the pastorals,
the  
disputed letters, and the genuine letters.  Nearly all scholars
recognize that  
the pastoral epistles (1 and 2 Timothy and Titus) are not actually by
the  
historical Paul but were written many years later by someone else.
 This writer  
was writing as though they were the now-dead Paul, possibly because
they felt  
their ideas would be easier to accept if the readers thought it was by
Paul,  
possibly because they believed that the letters contained teachings
that Paul  
himself *would* have given had he actually written the letter, or both.
 The  
second group, the disputed letters, are letters where scholars are
still divided  
on whether the historical Paul wrote them.  Some of these letters are
more  
uncertain than others, and if one was actually written by Paul it does
not mean  
that all of them were.  The disputed letters are Ephesians, Colossians,
2  
Thessalonians.  The genuine letters are the ones that the majority of
scholars  
feel were actually written by the historical Paul.  They are Romans, 1
and 2  
Corinthians, Galatians, Philippians, 1 Thessalonians, and Philemon.
 And while  
he was traditionally viewed as the author of the anonymously written
Hebrews,  
the evidence against Paul's authorship has been known for so long that
today  
there is no debate that Paul is not the author of Hebrews.

So the letter this verse comes from is still disputed between scholars
as to  
whether or not Paul really wrote it.  Part of the problem is its
similarity to  
many parts of Colossians.  Though there is still debate about both
letters, many  
scholars who believe that Paul might be the author of one posit that
the other  
was almost certainly constructed from it and is not by Paul.  In other
words, if  
Paul wrote Ephesians, most scholars believe that someone else used it
to  
construct Colossians, and vice versa.  And many scholars feel that
Colossians is  
the more likely of the two to be the original work, and that Ephesians
copied  
much of its contents from Colossians.

Did Paul Change His Perspective?
--------------------------------

One of the main reasons is that the Paul of Ephesians and Colossians has
a very  
different view of himself and of the Christian movement than the Paul
we've been  
reading in Romans and 1 Corinthians.  In the genuine letters, Paul
celebrates  
what Jesus's death and resurrection means for him and all believers.
 Genuine  
Paul feels that the Jewish Torah has been superseded by the new
covenant of  
Christ.  For genuine Paul, sin can only occur when a Christian is
attempting to  
live within the old covenants, or in other words is attempted to keep
the Law of  
Moses.  With the author of Ephesians andColossians, sin
occurs *always* when a  
Christian depends upon "good works" for salvation as opposed to
trusting in the  
"grace" of God.  There is little mention of the Law meaning the Jewish
Torah.  
And the apocalyptic perspective of the genuine letters is gone.  While
genuine  
Paul is concerned about being saved from the violence of the rapidly
approaching  
Kingdom of God and believes the resurrection will occur before the end,
the  
author of Ephesians believes that he has *already* been saved and even
seems to  
indicate that the resurrection has occurred!  These may seem like very
small  
distinctions, but even small distinctions matter.  If I were to give
you a  
General Conference talk written by either Jeffrey R. Holland or Thomas
S.  
Monson, chances are that a Mormon familiar with their particular styles
would  
easily be able to tell which one had written the talk.  They're both
Mormons who  
believe very similar things, but they have very different styles.

Also, when genuine Paul is writing to churches he uses the word to mean  
"congregations": the Church in Rome, the Church in Corinth, the Church
in  
Galatia, etc.  But the author of Ephesians and Colossians uses the
word  
*ekklesia* "Church" much the same way that the author of Matthew uses
it: as a  
general word meaning *all* believers in Jesus.  Whether they live in
Rome or  
Corinth the author of Ephesians is referring to everyone when he uses
the word  
"church".  This is very different than how we've been reading Paul
before now.  
For these reasons and more we should be extremely cautious about
approaching  
this letter assuming that the historical Paul wrote it.

Do Mormons Have Evangelists?
----------------------------

Chapter 4 of Ephesians has the author employing that the Church be
unified.  He  
states that there is "one Lord, one faith, one baptism", and implies
that the  
various offices within the Church were given for the purpose of
helping  
Christians remain unified through life.  That is the context for the
verses as  
given: unity.

One of the "articles of faith" formulated by Joseph Smith in 1844 reads:

> We believe in the same organization that existed in the primitive
> church:  
>  namely, prophets, apostles, pastors, teachers, evangelists, etc.

So most Mormons look at this verse as a description of a well-ordered
Church  
with many different roles.  Part of the problem, of course, is that
some of  
these positions do not exist within the LDS under the same names.  The
solution  
is usually to claim equivalence between a term listed by Paul and a
role within  
the LDS Church.  Pastors are usually interpreted by be bishops, and
there is a  
very definite linguistic connection between these two words.  However,  
"evangelists" are said to be Patriarchs.  In the LDS Church, a
Patriarch is an  
actual position whose calling is to provide a ritualized blessing upon
members o  
the ward.  This blessing is usually prophetic and mean to provide
guidance for  
the member's life.  However, the term Paul
uses, εὐαγγελιστάς *euangelistás,* is  
a complex word meaning "speakers of the good news".  It is the word
behind  
"evangelist" (change the *u* to a *v* and you'll see it) or
"evangelism".  For  
Paul and other early Christians, the word is usually related to
missionary work.  
While Paul could be referring to a position were someone delivers "good
news" in  
the same way that a Patriarch is usually expected to offer a divine
guide for  
the future, it is an odd choice of words to use a term that is already
used  
almost exclusively in another way elsewhere.

Also, when Joseph Smith made the statement that the LDS Church "believed
in the  
same organization that existed in the primitive church" (which is
different than  
saying that they *have* the same organization) the hierarchical
structure of the  
1844 LDS Church was *extremely* complex beyond this listing given by
Paul.  
Also, the structure of the LDS Church has *always* been in flux among
the  
Latter-day Saints.  Joseph's first official calling within his Church
was not as  
Prophet or President, but was rather as it's "First Elder".  High
Priests and  
the office of President appeared after Sidney Rigdon joined; some of
the Book of  
Mormon witnesses felt that the introduction of these positions only
occurred  
because the sophisticated Rigdon argued that Joseph's simple church
should have  
more positions.  Apostles were introduced in Kirtland soon after, first
designed  
to be a group of missionaries that only fully developed into purely
leadership  
roles after the movement of Brigham Young's followers to the Great
Basin.  
Joseph Smith also had many other groups that did not last beyond the
19th  
Century, such as the Council of Fifty and the Annointed Quorum.  Under
Brigham  
Young the Priesthood callings were organized as a youth program (before
this,  
deacons, teachers, priests, and elders were all adult men and
advancement in the  
LDS Priesthood did not necessarily move from deacon to teacher to
priest to  
elder).  In the 1970s the office of Seventy was removed at the local
level,  
reserved only to a collection of Church-wide Quorums of Seventy that
assist the  
LDS Apostles.  Who knows what changes the future will bring to the
structure?

Throughout all of these changes, members have continued to recite this
article  
of faith, usually believing that all early Christians had the same
organization  
they enjoyed.  However, finding this organization in the New Testament
requires  
a *lot* of assumption.  And everything we currently understand about
the early  
Christian movement reveals a collection of *very* different groups with
very  
different approaches, beliefs, practices, and organization.

When Paul is writing his angry letter to Galatia or to the unvisited
Christians  
in Rome, or is answering questions and responding to internal problems
in  
Corinth why doesn't he write to the local leaders?  In most letters
outside of  
Ephesians/Colossians and the Pastorals (which nearly all scholars feel
were not  
actually by Paul), Paul doesn't refer to a Church structure or to
Church offices  
apart from servants (deacons, both men and women), apostles (again,
both men and  
women), and widows (which soon after the time of Paul when the
Christian  
communities began to be more organized, were an actual office for women
in the  
Church that were set apart to serve as widows).

So while this is a good list showing groups that some early Christians
felt  
belonged to the Jesus movement, it would be very difficult to say that
either 1)  
this verse lists offices that *must* be found in the Christian Church,
or 2)  
this verse matches up very well against the current 21st Century
structure of  
the LDS Church.  It's not misused or misinterpreted (well, apart from
claiming  
that "evangelists" are Patriarchs), but it isn't a very good selection
to define  
what the LDS Church should look like.

Why Do I Think This Is Part of Scripture Mastery?
-------------------------------------------------

I think this scripture was chosen because it is quoted by Joseph's
Articles of  
Faith. It's reference to "Prophets" and "Apostles" is seen as evidence
that the  
original Christian movement still have prophets within it.  However,
even if  
there were prophets, this verse doesn't actually mean that they were in
charge  
or even that the Church continued to have them.  The author could be
referring  
to the Prophets from the history of Israel.  Besides, there is good
reason to be  
cautious about assuming the authenticity of these verses as having been
written  
by the historical Paul.  The most they show is that some early
Christians  
believed in various offices within the Christian movement that mostly
seem to  
line up with similarly named offices in the LDS Church, but the
relationship  
between both churches is much more problematic than it may originally
appear.
