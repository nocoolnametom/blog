## What is the LDS Inverse Old Testament?

I am assuming that *most* Sunday School teachers are both lazy and fearful of doing things wrong.  For this reason, even though the manual itself suggests that teachers use it merely as a guide and not as the lesson itself, most teachers are just going to use the lessons as written.  I am assuming that when the manual says "read Moses 4" referring to an entire chapter that this directive is usually *not* going to be followed.  It takes a long time to read a full chapter and it'd be easier to just summarize it, which introduces our own biases and assumptions far more easily.  Scriptures that *are* more likely to be read are the smaller snippets the manual lists in the catechism-like questions to be read and discussed.  From these assumptions it is easy to create a list of scriptures that are likely to be read and discussed by any typical LDS Sunday School class.  And from this list of scriptures it is easy to create the *inverse* of such a list and produce a list of scriptures that are *not* likely to be read and discussed by any typical LDS Sunday School class.  And, assuming that most Latter-day Saints do not read the Old Testament voluntarily or closely as they do the Book of Mormon or the New Testament, it is likely that this inverse list contains chapters and verses that the average member of the Church is likely to *never* read or discuss.

So I've begun to do just that.  I've gone through the lesson manual, highlighted the suggested scriptures, and then inverted the highlighting.  I've only spent about two hours on the project so far and have gotten to the Book of Numbers.  I'll keep posting more as I get further along.

## My Thoughts So Far

There is a **ton** of time spent in the Pearl of Great Price and Genesis compared to the rest of the Bible.

All of Abraham's astronomy is skipped except where it's useful.  A few verses about pre-existent intelligences are read from within the midst of conversation about Kokoabeum and how the sun and moon gets their light.  And the polytheistic renderings of the creation account in Abraham might as well as not exist since they receive no attention whatsoever in comparison to Moses/Genesis.

The genealogies are skipped (okay, that's actually not very noteworthy, I'd do the same).  Also skipped are the lists of instructions on how to build the Tabernacle in Exodus.

There are a number of stories that are skipped, probably because they are either 1) weird, 2) racist, or 3) show someone held up as a moral figure in a bad light.

Some of the verses that are skipped are ones that seem to stretch credulity in regards to these ancient stories by being too physical and real, such as the land that arises out of the ocean that the evil people opposed to Enoch's people retreat to, giants seeking the life of Noah, the angel wrestling with Jacob, or Moses's face shining so brightly that he has to put a veil over his face.

Moses 7:22 is such an obvious omission that I find it laughable.  Seriously, the reading of the verses before and after is meant to be a very close reading in class, but the verse itself is 100% absent from the readings suggested by the materials.

While it is recommended to "teach and discuss" the entirety of Moses 4 (the temptation of Eve by the snake) I find it notable that the scriptures listed to read are all about the *results* of the fall.  There is nothing recommended to read in class, unless it's the *entirety* of chapter 4, that covers the actual mechanics of the snake tempting Eve.  My personal speculation is that it is more than a little disturbing that the "Inspired Version" still presents this temptation as occurring *through a snake* even after introducing Satan as the force of evil trying to thwart the Creation.  This flies in the face of the LDS Temple drama where there is no snake and Satan himself does the temptation directly.  I think they don't want people to begin messing with the thorny questions of which of these two chapters, both revealed by the Prophet Joseph Smith, is the "more real" and "less symbolic" account of things.

I am surprised that the story of Judah and Tamar is meant to be discussed and even possibly read, but it is, along with the rape of Dinah (though, oddly enough, the following retaliatory murders by the sons of Jacob aren't really the focus of the story as presented in the manuals).

The attention paid to the Ten Commandments is somewhat sad when you consider that these commandments begin a series of several *chapters* of additional commandments, including such gems as "Neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine altar, that thy nakedness be not discovered thereon" and "Ye shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations upon the sabbath day".  The entire Book of Leviticus is also apparently useless for any attention by any given Sunday School.
