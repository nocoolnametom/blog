Slug: about

My name is Tom. When I started school and discovered things like
bulletin boards and forums (wow, I'm getting old now!) I couldn't think
of any cool username, so I decided to capitalize on that. Thus I am
NoCoolName\_Tom.<!--more-->

This is my
kinda-secret-but-not-so-secret-that-I'm-going-to-be-neurotic-about-it
blog detailing my thoughts as a disaffected Mormon (and pretty much
anything else I decide to put here). I welcome discussion and even
negative feedback, but this *is* my blog and I'll not deal kindly with
people trolling or just being morons. Respect isn't that hard to give
but it can be hard to earn. Approach things with respect and you'll
receive it back. I value facts beyond emotion, and cautious over
zealousness. You may not, and that's cool but don't get all up in my
face about it. We can all deal with things like rational people.

Oh, and I'm always far too wordy. I'm something of a [Polonius][] in
that regard: "brevity is the soul of wit". I've tried to tone it down in
the past, but I'd rather say too much than too little.
