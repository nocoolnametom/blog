All Done
--------

The last one. 25 scriptures from the New Testament; I hope it was as
much fun for you guys as it was for me. I'll probably take a short break before
I go back and look at the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) scriptures (plus, as I do
not know Hebrew, I need to find someone willing to do some translations and
spend some time talking about the implications of words in the various verses with
me).

Anyways, appropriately enough, we're at the end of John's visions. Big
battles have been fought between the Dragon and the Lamb, plagues have killed
many people, and angels have flown all over the place yelling stuff. It's
been a pretty crazy ride.

Now we near the end of the vision. This part is relatively
straightforward; well, at least as straightforward as Revelation ever gets.

The Context of the Scripture Mastery Verses
-------------------------------------------

An angel from heaven with a big chain is able to tie up the dragon, said
to represent Satan by John, ties him up and tosses him into an abyss
(which is then locked and sealed) so that for a thousand years he will not deceive the
nations. John then says that after those thousand years he'll be released for a
brief period of time.

Then he sees the righteous who have been made judges, including those
beheaded for not worshipping the beast. They're raised to life and rule during
the thousand years.

After this, John draws heavily upon the imagery of Ezekiel 38 and 39
(where Gog and Magog appear to be code names for specific countries, unlike in
the Revelation, where they appear to simply represent the human nations of
the earth) to present a final conflict of the world. The wicked are
destroyed by fire, and the dragon is thrown into a lake of fire forever.

Then John sees a large white throne with a figure on it, and heaven and
earth run away from this person. Then we get the verses in quesiton: the dead
are raised and are judged before the throne from "the books" and "another
book, the book of life". The ocean gives up her dead, death and the underworld
give up their dead, and then death and the underworld are thrown into the lake
of fire (the ocean isn't; it would put out the lake I suppose?). Finally
everyone whose name isn't in the book of life is also thrown into the lake of fire,
ending the chapter.

The rest of the book describes the glory and grandeur of the Kingdom of
God, described as a new heaven and a new earth, with a new Jerusalem.

Exciting stuff, I guess, though it's still rather odd to me now to read
it all.

Scholars don't really have much to add to these verses except to note
that there are multiple books mentioned. Possibly John is describing a book of
life and a book of death; everyone's name is written in one of the two books. But
it's impossible to tell for sure from the text.

The Mormon Applications - Records and Works
-------------------------------------------

So let's move on instead to the general Mormon approach. There's a
number of things we should discuss from this verse.

First, let's look at what Mormons think about those books. Mormons think
that the books opened are the records of the Church, recording such things
as baptisms, endowments, sealings, and so on. For this reason, Latter-day
Saints have tried to keep good records of their rituals and history. Some
Mormons even go so far as to say that these records will include our own diaries and
journal and stress the importance of such personal record-keeping. In 1842,
Joseph Smith wrote in a general letter,

>  "You will discover in this quotation that the books were opened; and another
>  book was opened, which was the book of life; but the dead were judged out of
>  those things which were written in the books, according to their works;
>  consequently, the books spoken of must be the books which contained the
>  record of their works, and refer to the records which are kept on the earth.
>  And the book which was the book of life is the record which is kept in
>  heaven; the principle agreeing precisely with the doctrine which is commanded
>  you in the revelation contained in the letter which I wrote to you previous
>  to my leaving my place—that in all your recordings it may be recorded in
>  heaven." *(D&C 128:7)*

Now I personally don't have much to add to this, except to say that I
don't think Joseph's logical extension that the books *must* hold works is
sound, since it is specifically stated that those who are NOT found in the
book of life are tossed into the fire. The simple presence of a name is enough to
save that individual from the fire. So it seems that the presence of the name in
the book occurs because of their works, for good presumably.

This leads to the second point, however, which I imagine is far more
important for CES teachers: the judgement occurs because of "works". So it's just
another repeat of what has come up many times before: salvation through faith
or salvation through works? Mormons feel that *sola fide* Christians do
not pay enough attention to verses like Revelation 20:12-13. Of course, the
reverse is also true where Mormons do not pay enough attention to verses by
individuals like Paul and Pseudo-Paul that indicate the supremacy of faith over
obedience to the Jewish Torah.

I Don't Get the Obsession With Proving Works Righteousness
----------------------------------------------------------

Where do I fall on this issues? I think that Matthew, James, and the
author of the Revelation, all Jewish Christians, are very clearly of the opinion
that salvation in the kingdom of God and from God's wrath is dependant upon
the way that you live, probably including adherence to the Jewish Torah. I also
think that Paul's theology is about a new covenant established through Jesus
and that the Jewish Torah has been superceded and is unnecessary. I don't try
and resolve the conflict because I see no need to. These are very different works
written by very different people.

However, now that we're at the end of the series, the fact that the very
last scripture mastery and the very first one, along with a number of verses
in between, can *all* be put to use teaching how God's judgement will be
about works (and, by it's absence, not by faith) makes me mad. It makes me
mad not because those scriptures are being used incorrectly, but because
those scriptures are being used as representative of the entire collection of
the Christian New Testament. They are not. There is not some underlying
agreement between all of the authors. There is no secret to resolving how Paul
and James look at things. But to give the false impression that the main message
of the Christian New Testament is one of works salvation is not only wrong,
but it is dishonest. And that is why the selection of this scripture bothers me
so much.

We had only one slot left. We could have spent it on countless other
things (in fact, my next post will be my *own* suggestions for 25 scripture
mastery selections that I think would be infinitely better than the current
list). Instead, the final selection is about works righteousness. It is yet
another opportunity for CES teachers to slam the beliefs of evangelical
Christians. I don't care if the Mormons are right about salvation or if the
evangelicals are right. Frankly, I like both approaches. The love inherent in the idea
of grace salvation inspires me, but my own personal sense of justice falls on a
works righteousness scale. My own personal theology pretty much consists of
living a good life and if there is a god in the next world then he'll honor that
good life or he's a jerk who isn't worth believing in anyways. So I guess
I'm a salvation by works guy, technically. But it bothers me that
alternative theologies are dismissed through this excessive proof-texting.

Why Do I Think This Is Part of Scripture Mastery?
-------------------------------------------------

I think this scripture was chosen for two reasons. First, it might be a
good opportunity to encourage students to keep their own records (such as
journal- writing) which is a good habit to keep. But secondly, it is probably
because they want to get the idea of salvation by works presented one last time
before the end of the year. While this scripture, in its context, certainly
supports this idea, the context of the entire collection of the Christian New
Testament does not, as it is a variegated collection of many different beliefs
and approaches to God and to Jesus. Ending on this note, with a silent, and
false, assumption of the New Testament's solidarity with itself in support of
LDS doctrine, is a disappointing end to a list that held good promise.
Perhaps in the future, as CES chooses new scriptures they'll encourage LDS youth
to memorize, they might select scriptures that do more than just entrench
particular LDS beleifs but instead choose scriptures that can actually
be used by students to help them get through that insanely stressful time of
high school. You know, something *useful*.
